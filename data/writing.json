        "p": "When I was a kid, X-Men was the only real story I had about people living in a state they knew was *wrong*, but so many other people refused to acknowledge was doing anything wrong because they were the tacit beneficiaries. This isn't to say that other stories along these lines did not exist, but simply that I did not organically encounter them.<br><br>I always knew there were many things horribly wrong with the world I lived in, I found adults' attempts to put a moral framework around it horrifying (who deserves to be unhoused?) and I hunted for narratives about people opposing something that was not only evil, not only bigger than themselves, but something they had to <i>convince</i> their peers was bad. It was about more than revolution - it was about validity, the difficulty in fighting to change something people refused to understand was evil.<br><br>You know, you're 9 years old, people are telling you that people in poverty deserve it. You're like, what? You find yourself not even knowing how to approach that argument because you're starting from such radically different worldviews and also 9 years old. Then, if you're little autistic me, then you're thinking \"oh yeah, Magneto would blast these fuckers\" (satisfying, perhaps a little amoral considering they are also 9 years old) or Professor X would fix them with debate (unrealistic but such a delicious fantasy), or maybe save their lives until they got too guilty to keep being bigots. Now that would be a good response! <br><br>These may not be applicable strategies but they were rational responses to the same conflicts I faced in my life, in a fictionalized context. Then, when my disabilities and queerness became more visible, and I started to attract bigotry that threatened my safety, I found fantasies of trying to subvert the status quo in X-Men. I remember reading <i>When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit </i>by Judith Kerr as a small child and seeing a passage about how to be a visible minority, you had to excel at whatever you were doing to prove the people who hated you wrong and give them no excuse to hurt you. I thought, huh, that's what Professor X would say, but it seems rather unfair to be forced to be a model citizen and representative of your entire demographic. <br><br>Now, whether or not X-Men actually supports subverting the status quo is a complicated question. The titular X-Men are doggedly dedicated to protecting existing state mechanisms, often at their own expense. I recently read a comic where, to my disgust, the plot resolution was that <a href=\"https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/5320197/x-men-operation-zero-tolerance-hc\">the US government simply decided to stop indiscriminately turning its own citizens into killer robots without their consent designed to commit hate crimes</a> because someone convinced them it was morally wrong with words. Charles Xavier is, in almost all iterations, the most boring liberal ever. But... although the text is telling you that violence is wrong and you need to turn the other cheek, the metanarrative is absolutely not telling you that. The metanarrative is a tragedy about how being a liberal who does nothing wrong means you keep getting blown up by people who hate you anyway. There are 2 contradictory aims in the story:<br><br><ol><li>Show that violence is never the answer and there are peaceful solutions to problems</li><li>Keep the primary conflict going forever so you can keep writing issues exploring minor variations of the same story again and again</li></ol>The consequence of this, is that you have a narrative where characters repeatedly try to turn the other cheek and are repeatedly killed for it. Again and again. Across all iterations of all universes... In all minor variations of the same situations... No matter what, their peaceful approach fails. So, while the characters are saying annoying things like \"violence is never the answer\" and \"we just have to convince them we're not evil\", the metanarrative is telling you \"these clowns do not have an effective strategy\". This dissonance is satisfyingly ironic. Then, in later issues <a href=\"https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/clavain/read-list/108800\">(in my opinion best handled in this arc</a>) the text addresses the impact this would have on the characters and their how it would shape their actions.<br><br>This is fascinating to me, even as an adult! These are questions I want to explore! Is violence an effective tool for change, is changing public opinion, is challenging state power? What is the psychological impact of dedicating your life to protecting the people who hate you? How will your own community react to your decision to do this? Are you betraying your own people? What do you do when people just don't acknowledge your humanity even after saving their lives? Why does the burden to seek justice always fall on the victims? In the cycle of violence, is there an effective way to differentiate victim and perpetrator? Should we train our children to protect themselves against a world that hates them; is their physical safety more important than the psychological safety of not knowing how much danger they are in?<br><br>As anyone who has thought about it for 5 seconds knows, mutants with super powers are a pretty shitty 1:1 allegory for real world marginalized groups. Mostly because they <i>are</i> dangerous and there is a rational basis to treating them differently (since you may be dealing with a small child who is shooting fire uncontrollably from their arms, or<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_(character)\"> the guy who explodes all the time for no reason</a>, or<a href=\"https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/search/121338?keyword=the%20worst%20x-man\"> the guy who explodes once and then he's exploded</a>). Real life marginalized groups do not pose such dangers. But not everything is literal; there's still a lot to be read into here and learned, and as someone with a stigmatized psychiatric disorder many consider dangerous perhaps I do relate to this metaphor on a more literal, if not 1:1, level... It does also help that X-Men has a very diverse cast, even if they are not always depicted in the best way.<br><br><blockquote class=\"npf_indented\"><i>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid because we exist, she says. There&rsquo;s nothing we did to provoke their fear, other than exist. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do to earn their approval, except stop existing &ndash; so we can either die like they want, or laugh at their cowardice and go on with our lives.&rdquo;</i><br><br>-- N.K. Jemisen, saying words I wish I had read earlier, doing a better job than X-Men with a similar concept in The Broken Earth Trilogy.<br><br></blockquote>But there's deeper problems than that in X-Men. There's frustrating cowardice when it comes to depicting violence, there's a dogged and tired inclination towards \"what if we just politely requested that the people kicking us stopped and it worked\". I was okay with that. You can read X-Men and love Emma Frost for her triage, for her unapologetic refusal to be anyone but herself or regret her morally grey actions. Y<a href=\"https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/clavain/read-list/109518\">ou can relate to Wolverine's compassion when he insists that they need to stop using child soldiers, even as you equally understand Cyclops's insistence that it's necessary because the outcome where they use child soldiers will result in overall fewer dead children</a>. You can understand that a public figure steadfastly dedicated to being peaceful is doing a lot of good, even as you can understand why the more vulnerable members of his community may hate him for his refusal to act more directly. There's a lot to take from the text even if you don't agree with all the creative decisions.<br><br>But. Oh man. There are. Problems bigger than this.<br><br>My favourite X-Men character is Magneto. He starts off as a villain but more often than not he aligns himself with the X-Men out of a sense of solidarity and an old homoerotic friendship, even becoming their leader a few times. Magneto is a Holocaust survivor who has repeatedly lost everything due to the hatred people hold for his various identities. He goes around telling people to stop being little shits and zapping them if they do hate crimes. His general line is \"I survived one genocide I will not endure another, no matter what moral line I have to cross, I will do everything in my power to stop that from happening again.\"<br><br>He knows that liberalism won't work. But he also tries it now and then just to be sure, because he cares more about results than ideology.<br><br>But! As I learned recently, Magneto is a huge Zionist and explicit supporter of the state of Israel. Which makes the \"I will cross any moral line to stop the genocide of my people from happening again\" into a very different statement, something people can link to the actions of the state of Israel which have everything to do with making more genocide and nothing to do with preventing another Holocaust. Yesterday I was minding my own business reading a comic that made alarming and tasteless allusions about slavery when <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Ruth_Bat-Seraph_(Earth-616)\">Zionist Woman</a> showed up and started talking about how progressive Israel was and how they would never do anything discriminatory unlike all the other countries :/ <br><br>Yeah, fictional and goofy anti-discrimination media for children really does not have a place for supporting actively genocidal states. This introduces a second level of dissonance, but unlike before, this is just uncomfortable and impossible to ignore. Attempts are made to introduce <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_(character)\">positive Arabic characters</a> but this is not enough and could not be enough.<br><br>It's a very disconcerting experience, to see Zionism Woman show up in the middle of your comic about the guy with knife hands and the other guy with laser eyes. All charitable interpretations evaporate. You close the comic and think about all the times the characters you like collaborate with the US military to do imperialism in fictional countries. It removes a layer of important abstraction that let you keep reading before - the idea that this was a story, removed somewhat from real life, that you could critically read and use as a vehicle to think about some issues while pointedly ignoring how it depicts others. Then you start thinking about how the organization that produced this comic also receive funding from the US military and making some horrible propaganda films. And you start wondering when USAmerican imperialism became so normalized in your mind that it didn't jump out at you as unforgiveable propaganda for a different genocide and instead became something you expect. All the things you were vagues aware of, trying to wave off thinking about death of the author, how the problematic party here isn't even directly the author, how most USAmerican media is like this anyway, are drawn sharply into focus. You start thinking about the explicit textual agenda to avoid violent uprisings, to maintain the status quo. And you can't analyse it away because it's not vague, it's not something you can take apart and put back together in a better shape in your head. Because the genocide woman is there, and she's peering out of the page at you, grinning ghoulishly, reminding you what this comic is actually for.<br><br>"

Then, slowly, all that was not them began to gain definition and consciousness. This shadow defined by their light became the Space Before and After and Between.<br><br>In one violent act, the Space Before created the World and shattered the shadow into three irreconcilable fragments. The Space Before became Syra of the World he had just created, the Space Between became Saynu of the Veil, and the Space After became Sakharek of the Void.

Saynu was incapable of both love and malice, driven by a vision only she could see.<br><br>Sakharek, Annihilation, God of the Void remained unknown in their exclusion.

He grew up wild. Forgot his name and language. Killed to eat and ran to avoid being eaten. When he slept he dreamed of his mother – like him, but bigger, stronger – and he remembered her death. It wasn’t teeth in flesh or breath stolen by water. It was a whirl of dark feathers and a sudden stillness, an absence. Something taken from her that could never be returned. When he dreamed of his mother he realized that he didn’t know death. He woke up scared. Ran from the place of his sleeping, trying to escape his shadow because it reminded him of his mother’s killer.<br><br>People tried to help him, as people do. They approached him with offers of food, of help, of shelter. He bristled and fled. They were bigger than him – threatening – and they were not his mother. She was gone, stolen by the dark. He hated them because they were not his mother. He knew their sweet smells to be lies, attempts to trap him. Their cries and hissing through their teeth unnerved him. Their language was not theirs or his – it was his mother’s. It belonged to the dead. The living should be silent. Noise startled animals away; noise meant hunger.<br><br> <br><br>Winter came and he almost froze. Slept in a cave or under a rock. Sucked on snow or ice, dug out toads for sustenance, started a lifelong habit of dangerous thinness. In spring he ate wild onions and squirrels and baby birds. In autumn he ate blackberries but avoided mushrooms after several lingering sicknesses by their hands. In winter again, he dug out hibernating hedgehogs and scooped their flesh from the spines, ate it raw. Fire belonged to the dead. Fire was not for something as wild as he was.<br><br>He eked life out of the forest for years. Never thought he’d stop. The local people knew him – the wild boy – and they left him. Superstitious folk, they thought him a changeling or goblin. Feared his bared teeth and wolflike snarl, the utter incomprehension in his eyes when they tried to talk to him. They couldn’t understand him, hated him in their own quiet way. Every winter they looked at each other and agreed that this would be his last. No one could survive outside in snowfall this deep, let alone a naked child. But he did. And their animosity grew.<br><br> <br><br>One summer, the sun beat down and there was a drought. At first it was a blessing. The frogs were easy to catch, dying without his intervention, and fish were plentiful. He gorged himself. Then they began to rot and other things started to die, too. Water was scarce, muddy, highly contested. Although he was bigger now, he still had to run from some things – bears, wolves, boar – and they fought each other for the remaining puddles. He watched them from the tops of trees. Scared and thirsty, he helplessly watched them splash in it. The bear defecated in the stagnant remains of the river.<br><br>He had to drink it, but knew it would make him sick. He feared the sickness but the thirst was stronger, more urgent. His throat burned. He leaned down to touch the puddle and his fingertips glowed. He sprang back, but there was nothing there. Again, he lowered his fingertips into the water, scared, ready to run, and they glowed. The water became clear, fragrant. He drank it and it tasted better than any water he had ever drunk. It was in this way that he discovered his Gift. If he had been in the village he would have been revered for it – it was uncomplicatedly useful and would protect them from cholera. But he was not in the village, and the village had no Gifts like his, or any at all.<br><br> <br><br>Neraverine’s domestication began shortly afterwards. The black whirlwind that had killed his mother appeared in front of him one day, a flurry of wings with countless yellow eyes scattered along its form. If he had thought his memory had exaggerated its monstrousness, he was wrong. Torn between fight and flight, fury and fear, he bit it as hard as he could and then tried to run.<br><br>It caught him easily, and held him by the arm, unrelenting, ignoring his thrashing nails and teeth. It spoke to him in the language of his mother, of the village, the language he had forgotten, of hisses and hums and smacks of lips. He would not hear it or understand. It talked for a long time, tone wavering, inviting fear and anger but above all else helplessness. Eventually, it departed. He looked at his nails which had broken in his escape attempts and something stirred within him.<br><br> <br><br>Later, a Woman came for him, smelling of the delicate purple flowers of spring. She sought him with patience and insight the villagers had lacked and succeeded in luring him close by. He would not be touched, so she did not touch him. At first, he would only eat what he knew, so she put out wild berries and bitter dandelion leaves, but then he began to accept sweet-smelling fruits and cooked goat. He would stay near to her and she would speak to him. At first, he hated it. Language belonged to the dead and his mother and her murderer. But eventually his tolerance grew, helped by goat's cheese and gentleness.<br><br>He started to remember things. Before the Woman, he did not remember. He did not think. He just was. He fought or fled from anything that reminded him of his old life, of a forgotten time when his mother had not been dead. Now, he got flashes, and with them, words. Trauma had stolen his voice and his past, but under the Woman’s patient hand they regrew. He pointed at things and rasped until he caught the right sound, then she would move her face in a way he found pleasing.<br><br>As his sentences returned and he crawled out of his mental wilderness, he began to grieve. For his mother, for himself, for years alone in the wilds forgetting. Sorrow was fleeting but rage buried itself deep. His memories stuck into him like burrs.<br><br>She told him stories to cement his language. She spoke about the Gods – Hope and Sin – sang him the Song of Saving every solstice as is traditional. She spoke about the Witness, about the Messiah, about how Hope had disappeared behind the Veil. The time is almost upon us, she said solemnly, when Sin will descend and the story will begin. We only have a short time. He nodded and didn’t quite understand – thought that it was some kind of game. It was unclear whether it was history or myth, or perhaps both.<br><br>The Woman waited until he could talk fluently, and understood the world enough, and then she left. She explained it to him, that she had to go but she would be back one day. Until then, he was to wear clothes and go into the village. He could live in her hut and tend her garden and goats.<br><br>He now knew the difference between disappearance and death. He was not who he had been. He did not protest just as he did not protest when the birds took flight, simply watched her go. He went to the village and learned more about people, like she had instructed, and decided that he preferred it in the quiet woodland hut. He remained there, isolated, but brimming with language. His internal thoughts were dense and rich, and he would whisper them to the trees and walls and goats. He whispered of anger, of the helplessness of it. He still had no Name, the Woman had said they did not yet need Names between them. It had been true but now she was gone he felt the throbbing hollow of it.<br><br> <br><br>The goats became sick and died. The garden withered. Hunger forced him into the village where they distrusted him. There was work in summer and autumn, but in winter they refused him lodging or food. Nothing to be done, they would say. He would go back to the forest and dig for toads and acorns, although it was so much more difficult than it had been. Once, this life hadn’t bothered him, but now he would narrate his own actions to himself with quiet bitterness. He hated the snow. He hated the village. He hated that he couldn’t hibernate like a toad. He hated the cold.<br><br>He thought often about his way with water. The Woman had told him that it was a Gift, that some people had Gifts, but that it was better to be quiet about them. He also thought about his mother. He did not know the name of the black whirlwind, nor could he remember what it had said to him, but he was certain that it had been real. Whatever it was, it was beyond his comprehension, and he spent days trying to convince himself that it had just been a man in a cloak. It had had a human face. That much he remembered. A human face fanged and furred. One day it might return, like it had just before he met the Woman.<br><br>His last point of rumination was his Name. You weren’t supposed to tell people your Name, so his Namelessness went largely unnoticed by the village folk. They called him Northrend because on the day he had arrived the icy snow bound by the north wind had followed. But that was a name, not a Name. He knew that he already had one, but that it had been lost with his mother. Again and again, he tried to recall it, and failed. Until I am Named, he thought, I am lost.<br><br>During the years he spent on the outskirts of the village, his disdain for people became more venomous. He didn’t hate humanity – the Woman had been human, and he himself was human – but he did hate them. They laughed at him, called him wild, mocked his diet and homelessness. The children sang cruel rhymes about him, the adults refused him payment for work on whim. He had always had hunger, even when wild, and it slowly began to turn into spite. Northrend, as he was known, began to quietly sabotage the villagers in petty acts of vengeance. He killed livestock, poisoned wells, started fires. None of it sated his hunger, his fury. His mother was dead and his life had been hard and people were cruel. The weather was cold and the earth was frozen so it hurt to sleep on. He didn’t simply hate humanity – he hated the world and everything in it. Over time, as the Woman never returned and fungi conquered the hut, he began to hate her too. The only one he could never hate was his mother. She had not chosen to die.<br><br>The villagers prayed to Hope, the Lightbringer. She was the goddess most commonly worshipped. If Northrend had prayed, he would have for his mother. But they would not allow him in their church, and he didn’t understand prayer nor divinity. The stories were just stories. He worshipped nothing. The silence of his forests, once sacred, now infuriated him. He remembered the stories the Woman had taught him and sang at the solstice. It was not so much religion as habit. The words angered him. Somehow, they recalled his mother, and it hurt to think of her.<br><br> <br><br>Northrend was singing to himself under his breath when his mother’s killer resurfaced. He did not stop to look at it. He ran. It spoke to him and he would not hear its words. The inhuman cluster of wings and eyes kept reappearing in front of him wherever he turned. Upon seeing it, he would rapidly change direction to be fleeing from it. It kept trying to speak to him but he refused to listen. If there was one thing Northrend was good at, it was running. He had had a lot of practice. He could keep going for a very long time.<br><br>After about an hour on foot he felt a searing pain in his back. Something was digging its claws in there. He tried to shake it off in utter desperation, but to no avail. Then it started to <em>pull</em>. It anchored him. No more running. Northrend watched in utter horror as his feet left the ground. The feathered beast was dragging him up into the air with invisible talons. Some of its wings battered his body. He struggled and keened.<br><br>It had lifted him about ten meters up, it dropped him.<br><br>Northrend landed with a crunch. Immediately, he tried to push past the pain to get up and run again. Anything to be away from this aberration. But his legs screamed in protest. They were broken. He couldn’t stand.<br><br>“Are you going to listen to me now?” The shadow spoke and he heard. He didn’t want to hear, but he heard.<br><br>Northrend thought about screaming to drown out the words. He thought about blocking his ears. No, he decided, those would not be necessary. He could simply ignore the words. Pretend to not hear.<br><br>“Neverine?” Northrend startled. That wasn’t his name – he knew that, because otherwise he would be Named and bound to answer the inquiry. But it did hold power over him. It was an approximation – almost his name. The word made him realize that he did still have a Name, even if he had forgotten it.<br><br>He would not speak to it. It would, however, speak to him.<br><br>“Neverine, answer me.”<br><br><em>No.</em> Unspoken. The feathered beast stepped on his broken legs. Northrend screamed because he had to. Screaming was not words; his silence endured. Again, the demon danced on his broken bones and beat him with its horrifying overlapping wings, and still Northrend would not utter a syllable. Furthermore, he did his utmost to forget everything he heard as quickly as possible. This enraged it. Northrend was quietly satisfied at the success of his rebellion. He would not collaborate with the murderer of his mother.<br><br>Hours of pain and pride later, the aberration left. He dragged himself across the ground with his arms into the shadow of a tree and started digging for grubs. He remembered the Woman (he wished he knew her Name, but also did not want to carry her as a presence in his head) telling him basic medical knowledge, and did his best to set his broken legs.<br><br>That night he shivered away in unbearable cold and pain. He shook and was silent. <em>Am I to die?</em> He asked himself. <em>If I must die, am I to die Nameless?</em> But he did not die yet. It took two more days of paralysis, unable to care for himself or reach water, before he succumbed.<br><br>The black-feathered beast came for him. Northrend knew he was dying. He did not relish it but was glad of the despair on its face.<br><br>“Neverine. You press against the Veil.” It looked grave. “I leave you here for a few days and already you hunger for the Void. Fragile mortal. Now I have to bring you back.”<br><br>With a beat of its great black wings, the dark entity restored Northrend to his former state. He twitched his legs and found them healed. He could run. And he did, ignoring the screaming beast behind him. He ran until no one was following him, then he found food in his usual fashion and slept.<br><br>Twice more, the monstrous cluster of wings and eyes visited him. Twice more, he continued with his behaviour despite the pain and death it brought him.<br><br>All of the running had moved him far into the forest. He could have found the village again if he had wanted to, but he did not. Instead, he returned to his wild ways. If not for his dogged pursuer, he might have forgotten language once more. He slept out under the stars.<br><br> <br><br>One cold morning he woke up shivering. He had slept on the leaves – since something kept reviving him from death, he no longer cautiously kept to the trees. Immediately, he startled and backed away, because the Woman was in front of him. He did not know what to say to her. He stared at her. As always, she was haunted by the fragrance of violets. She looked at him, noticing that he was awake.<br><br>“Child,” She greeted, “I’m happy to see you alive and relatively unharmed. Why won’t you talk to Syra?”<br><br>Northrend knew that name. It was one of the twin gods from the songs, an old and forbidden Name mortals were never to speak. The Woman had taught it to him. He shook his head – the killer of his mother was no god.<br><br>“You are Neverine of the Song of Saving. You must obey Sin and act out his theatre across the land.” Again, the Name that was both his Name and not. Like the moth whose back resembled a snake.<br><br>He did not fully understand. “I won’t talk with my mother’s murderer.” He felt an aching in his chest that she would think to ask that of him. He owed her for the hybrid gift of language and sanctuary. Of all the humans he had met, only his feelings for her approached love, never quite there, but always reaching fondly in that direction. Even in her absence, the resentment had not eclipsed the tenderness.<br><br>“But otherwise he will hurt you.”<br><br>“Then let it hurt me. It has already killed me, I do not see what more it can do.”<br><br>“He will keep hurting you.” She insisted, passionate. “He will keep hurting you and hurting others until you listen to him. He will hurt you more than you think possible.”<br><br>Northrend considered her advice. She could be right. It was unlikely that he could outlast the immortal. He was already so close to listening, his tenacity had human limits. There were only so many times someone could die before they forgot everything that had mattered to them. Even so, his stubbornness clawed inside his chest each time he awoke, preceding his identity or body, a ghost pushing him forwards. It was his onus. Of all things, it was first to arrive and last to fade. How could he explain it? The unconquerability of the wild. The thirst to run and not look back, the willingness to hurt in pursuit of that unreachable goal. Freedom.<br><br>“It can’t make me do anything.” Northrend decided. It was true. The more he was hurt, the more he hated, and the more entrenched the idea of resistance became. It could break his legs, it could carry him above the tree canopy with vast black wings and drop him on his head. It could not make him listen. It was not within its power. Vicious satisfaction bubbled up at the idea, of the gift of having something someone wanted and denying them it. He wished he could inflict the same powerlessness on the villagers.<br><br>“He can.” The Woman insisted. Her voice was no longer gentle. “He will, Neraverine.”<br><br>The Name sent a jolt down his spine. He felt found. He felt seen. <em>Neraverine</em>. He felt targeted. In an instant, he understood it: <em>Equal-Opposite-Force</em>. It was his Name. There was no mistaking it. He looked at her closely. Who was the Woman, to know his name? The name given by his mother, his mother who was more symbol than memory.<br><br>“Did you know her?” Neraverine pushed his brow against hers, hands gripping her shoulders. “How do you know my Name?” Too late, he realized that the words that had left his mouth had not been in the language she had taught him. He caught himself, fascinated by what had left his mouth. What were these sounds he made, this language he spoke? It sounded like the Woman’s songs. Not the Song of Saving, no, the Song of Cycles whose dulcet tones she produced each eclipse, partial or full.<br><br>“I know you.” She told him. “I knew her. I am Leun.” <em>Watcher, witness</em>, a word that encapsulated every part of this woman. Neraverine held it in his mind like a threat. There was power and beauty in a Name. “You are a hero from the songs. Syra wants you to play your part. He will tell you what to do, you will do it, and the World will be saved. It is your destiny.”<br><br>A song? What was a song but a series of sounds? What was the world but a forest and a village filled with people he despised? Why would he want to save it? Neraverine shook his head. He had no desire to save anyone. He wanted to live in the derelict little house alone with the goats’ bones and the overgrown garden. He wanted to eat berries and sleep in trees. He wanted a hot season that would never end.<br><br>“I don’t believe in destiny. Songs are just words.” He pushed her away so forcefully that she fell onto the blanket of leaves and cried out. No matter. She was not backing him. It could not push her from his heart, although Neraverine was slow to love and quick to hate. Still, there was damage done that could not be undone.<br><br>“Goodbye, Leun. We will not meet again.” He meant it, although he could not have been more wrong.<br><br> <br><br><em>Equal-Opposite-Force</em>. Neraverine. He turned it over in his mind.<br><br>Neraverine pushed his foot against the ground. In return, the ground pushed back against his foot – equally strong, oppositely directed. Then, his hand gripped a tree branch. As he pulled it, it pulled against him, making soft indents in the palms of his hands. He breathed in and held it. The air, pulled in his body, struggled to be exhaled. He released it.<br><br>His feet, firmly pressing down on into the moist earth, were in turn pushed upwards. This static exchange repeated when he lifted a foot and placed it down again. In fact, while moving the leg upwards, he could feel the air pushing down equally hard. This was philosophy, or something like it. Physical and without language, a simple occurrence he could wordlessly consider.<br><br>With his head tilted in curiosity, Neraverine pressed one of his palms into the other. Then, carefully, he exerted equal force. Soon, his arms were shaking from the effort, but neither palm had pushed the other. In a sense, it was as though the motion did not exist at all.<br><br>He thought about this alleged God, Syra, who had killed his mother. It was a blurred shape in his mind, a sense of malevolence. What would it take to annihilate it like he could annihilate the movement of his palms? A reflection, pushing back with the same force.<br><br>There had been a slab of special glass in Leun’s hut.<br><br><em>I am a mirror</em>. Neraverine thought.<br><br> <br><br>The murderer of his mother was nothing if not persistent. Neraverine’s hatred was at the core of him, wrapped in meat and bone, spurring his resistance. But the monster was relentless, so it was only a matter of days before his heart was exposed. It did not matter that it was his everything. It did not matter that he considered himself nothing without it. All that mattered was that he would do anything to make the pain stop, as any animal did, survival overwriting the baser urge to scratch his tormentor’s face off.<br><br>“Listen.” It hissed, face furred and pupils elliptical. Unlike any other animal. Neraverine found himself empty and tired and unable to produce any sound to drown out the words from the fanged mouth pressed to his ear. “Listen, Neverine.”<br><br>“Not my Name.” Neraverine tried to croak. The words did not leave his throat, they died with his slackening muscles. But the monster heard all the same, plucking the words from a future where Neraverine had been able to speak them.<br><br>“It is your Name now. You understand?” It stepped on his throat. Neraverine’s eyes became glassy, he did not choke because his lungs had already stopped moving. He waited to be reborn. His vision faded but his mind did not dim with it. He could still feel the breath on his ear, the weight on his throat. “You are Neverine and you are going to follow the Song of Saving.”<br><br><em>Why?</em> Neraverine thought. <em>Why? </em>It was a question without satisfactory answer. It did not have a reason beyond that the monster had chosen him. It simply was.<br><br> <br><br>As he became older and his limbs grew, Neraverine began to understand compromise. It wasn’t the world he understood, no. Nor humanity, the vague and shapeless masses that had left him to the forest, no, never those. But he still knew the forest and he learned compromise. It was not a question of compromise or die. It was rather about experiencing both and hoping that by learning the former he could assay the latter. He cooperated. He died. He resisted. He died. He began to understand futility. Then he died.<br><br>“You are stupid, Neverine. Your existence offends me. You know no reverence.” Syra said. He used its Name now, resignedly, because it was necessary to address this monster as an equal. It was Named even though it was not human. It was the way of things. The Woman – Leun – was not quite human either. He saw her rarely. She came to pull him back together, to patch the mental wounds. He now understood that she did it in Syra’s service and hated her more for it.<br><br>He had asked her why she did it. She said that it was to allay a curse set upon her by Syra’s sister, Saynu. Usually, when pressed, she would say no more on the subject. But one clear evening under a cloudless celestial canopy, she told him that it was because she loved Neraverine like her son. This hurt him more than dying, more than the first time she had left him alone in the hut with the goats. After that, he never asked again.<br><br>Neraverine did not argue with Syra. He had had enough pain for today. Instead, he nodded and let his mind drift away, so tired. Syra’s words wove a cage around him and he did not heed them, simply nodding and continuing to nod, as though he had heard them. Neraverine was only capable of so much self-betrayal. He could bear to listen to the monster’s words only rarely, and even more rarely could he endure following its instructions.<br><br>Eventually, the being he had come to understand was a God flew away. Neraverine tried not to look at it directly – the hundreds of wings furled into the vague silhouette of a man studded with eyes and jewels that sometimes hit the light in a way that almost made it appear convincingly human.<br><br>He felt strangely unafraid when faced with Syra. His physiology responded to pain. But at the end of the day, the God was desperate. It wanted something only Neraverine could provide. It created an odd dependency. Even as Neraverine was slain, he felt somehow in control. Then his exigency for agency would reassert itself and he would resist, flee, disengage in any way he knew how. At the end, it was Syra who would be peering into Neraverine’s pained grimace, convincing itself that this time it had gotten through to him.<br><br>Neraverine did not give Syra what it wanted. He reflected the violence, the desperation, the stubbornness. When pushed, he pushed back.<br><br> <br><br>It was difficult not to give in. He teetered sometimes on the edge of inevitability, wondering what it would be like if he surrendered. Then he redoubled his efforts. He felt as though he was at the bottom of a deep deep hole, and whatever motions he or Syra made only excavated it further, trapping him in a position where he was forced to react instead of act. He hungered to make a choice of his own.<br><br>The problem was the gulf in power between Syra and Neraverine. The solution was having nothing to lose.<br><br>He had once sung the Song of Saving at the solstice, so Neraverine knew that if he was to be Neverine the Messiah then his death was preordained. If he was dying for the ungrateful world anyway then it didn’t matter if Neraverine was hurt - he wanted to hurt Syra.<br><br>He knew that if he yielded to leverage it would be repeated, so he spat in the face of threats, exaggerated them, played along until they reached absurd proportions he was certain that Syra would not carry out. It would start with a threat to burn part of his home forest and Neraverine would laugh, letting his composure drop, something unhinged and hungry slipping out, and ask, why only one forest? Syra, determined not to be denied, would carry out the bigger threat anyway.<br><br>The grief, the knowledge that Syra would do something so monstrous, was cathartic. Then Syra would drop Neraverine on his head until he died. Neraverine would wake up laughing, nothing in him recognizable as Neverine the Messiah demanded by the Song of Saving.<br><br>The World inched towards the apocalypse."

To her right and left, bouquets of fresh sunflowers from her fields bloomed, filling the air with a refreshing and earthy scent to offset the stagnancy of old stone. She had not always been surrounded by such grandeur. For a long time, she had inhabited the dusty library of an abbey, then there had been long hours in the chapel praying to Goddess Hope. But, at the end of it all, she had passed the trials and this was her reward: young sunlight painted rainbow by stained glass framing her face in a halo, the echoing of a distant choir singing her glory, gold and marble all around, a hefty amulet of office collaring her neck over exquisitely embroidered robes. She was now the Living Emissary of Hope: radiant, young, and powerful.<br><br>Before her, stood a frail woman. She was thin and ageless. Unlike most who sought an audience in the marble cathedral, she looked clearly at the High Priestess without fear. One eye shone green, the other a pale blue. One pupil dilated more than the other due to the heterochromia, causing the impression that the woman was not exactly seeing, even if she was looking.<br><br>The woman tilted her head sideways. The High Priestess smiled. She was unaccustomed to a lack of deference in her audiences and found the novelty of it enjoyable.<br><br>“I am Leun the Witness.” The woman announced softly, gesturing towards the High Priestess as though also expecting an introduction. How bold. At least she had the courtesy to give the High Priestess her Name directly, as was the customary gesture of deference.<br><br>“I am Nameless.” The High Priestess lied, humouring this odd woman. It should not have been a lie. The High Priestess surrendered her identity when she passed the trials. It was essential that she have no attachments, no peers, no memories but those of duty. It was the only way she could serve as the Living Emissary of Hope. But the incumbent High Priestess – Yuumei – had never truly given up her Name, nor her past. It was a secret held between herself and her God, Hope. “You may call me High Priestess.”<br><br>“High Priestess.” Something shifted in the woman’s face. Yuumei leaned forwards to catch the expression, but it was already gone. “I come bearing news. The time for the Song of Saving has come. Neverine the Messiah walks among us. He requests your assistance on his journey.”<br><br>Yuumei laughed. This was different to a plea for prayers or gold. No one had asked such a thing of her before. Of all the lies…<br><br>“I am quite serious.” The woman – Yuumei had already forgotten her Name – said. “I will demonstrate my credentials.”<br><br>In an instant, Yuumei saw a flash of steel emerge from the woman’s belt. She did not shout – poise was one of the few duties of the High Priestess – but she did flinch back, expecting another assassination attempt but equally certain that her guard would prevent it as they had the others. However, the woman made no move towards Yuumei. Instead, she raised her arm and plunged the blade into her own chest, directly above her heart. The arterial spray stopped just short of her throne.<br><br>The High Priestess blinked. This was sacrilegious – this was holy ground. A righteous anger rose within her. They would have to burn the body of this madwoman in an extensive ceremony to remove the stain. This was not the first time someone had killed themselves before Yuumei in this very room, but it was the most senseless. There was no complaint of the Church’s activity, no plea for a different policy. Just madness.<br><br>Moments after the woman had stopped twitching, her hand began to move. She gripped the dagger and pulled it from her own chest. Yuumei blinked. Then, miraculously, the woman rose back to her feet. She was not breathing heavily. The wound on her chest appeared gone. A divine miracle, or a trick? It was the High Priestess’s duty to determine that.<br><br>Yuumei rose, careful not to tremble. She waved her guard back as she marched up to this curious woman and touched her breast, where the dagger had pierced her. The skin was smooth and cold, smelling faintly of violets. There was no obvious mechanism which could have produced the blood. Yuumei withdrew her hand with a gasp, her face freezing in a grimace.<br><br>“You are a prophet?” Yuumei asked, trying to sound sceptical, backing away, pushing away the urge to kneel. She had to remain composed. This could yet be deception, even though she knew it wasn’t.<br><br>There was blood seeping across the gold-veined marble, black in the sunlight. The gore in the air bled into the scent of spring flowers, leaving Yuumei’s senses overwhelmed. But this was not as severe as her trials – above all things, Yuumei had mastered composure. Beneath her cool exterior her heart roiled violently, urging her to flee.<br><br>“If you like.” The woman’s voice was flat, unconcerned. “Was that sufficient evidence, or would you like to do the deed yourself?” She offered the hilt of the bloodied blade to Yuumei.<br><br>Yuumei tried her utmost to act with conviction in everything that she did. That was the mark of the Living Emissary of Hope. You could not do wrong and you could not leave your back exposed. Aware of the responsibility she carried, and her own vulnerability, she took the knife in her hand. It shook, once, as she examined the space over the woman’s heart.<br><br><em>I may well kill this woman</em>. Yuumei thought grimly. She had not killed someone with her own hands since her trials. It was not appropriate for the Living Emissary of Hope. But she did not trust any of her guard to do the action on her behalf. There were always whispers, always schemes, looking to discredit Yuumei and brand her as a witch so another could take her place. She was, as always, aware that she was the first high Priestess without a Gift in the Church’s history, and that this made her position precarious. There was too much risk in handing the task to another. To hold the position of High Priestess, you had to be willing to kill, she had known that and taken the position anyway.<br><br>Shuddering slightly despite her best efforts, Yuumei pushed the point of the blade into the woman’s chest. It sank a small distance and quickly met resistance. Frowning, she pushed harder, using both hands. Still, her pale digits lacked the conviction to pierce the breastbone. The woman’s own hand, now shaking with pain, guided the knife upwards. Then it slipped, easily as through butter, between her ribs and into her heart.<br><br>This time the blood hit Yuumei’s face. Some landed on her lips. She did not flinch. There had been worse in her early candidacy, during the trials. Reminding herself of this fact, Yuumei clung tightly to her composure. It took a woman of immense strength to hold the position of High Priestess without a Gift. She released the dagger as the woman sank to the ground.<br><br>As she had been taught, long ago by her herbalist birth mother, Yuumei pressed two fingers to the woman’s neck. No pulse. Then, she carefully laid her ear to the woman’s mouth. No breath. Dead. Yuumei rose to her feet, quietly relieved that she had dodged this peril. Then, a cold bloodied hand gripped her own. The woman blinked. Yuumei’s mouth opened unconsciously, inadvertently letting some of the blood drip inside.<br><br>“As I explained, our foretold messiah requests your company on his journey. The Song of Saving is coming to pass.” Still, the woman’s voice did not tremble. There was no hint of pain in it.<br><br>Yuumei dug her nails into her palm. She did not awaken. For the first time since her ascension, Yuumei bowed her head. She felt a ripple of tension run through her court at the gesture of respect. Something in this woman was divine.<br><br>“Miraculous prophet.” Yuumei murmured. “I am honoured to meet one such as yourself. Of course, I will follow your instructions.”<br><br> <br><br>Yuumei felt odd, wearing practical clothes, following this woman into the wilderness with only a small knapsack for company. This was the kind of drudgery she had thought behind her after ascension. In all likelihood, she would lose her office in her absence. The Church was not as pious as it pretended to be – ambition ruled. Still, there was a certain joy thrumming under her breastbone. The trials had chosen her as High Priestess at such a momentous time in history that she would be able to meet their messiah and help him save the world; it was a meaning beyond meaning, the kind of thing children acted out in their imaginary games.<br><br>The woman’s eyes shone like mirrors in the gloom, covered by a reflective film like those of a cat. She still unsettled Yuumei. There was something unfeeling about this woman. As High Priestess, Yuumei was supposed to shed the vestiges of mortality, things like attachments and memory, but she had always failed, as she suspected all High Priestesses before her had. But this woman, hollow and glass-eyed, embodied the kind of otherworldly terror Yuumei had considered unattainable.<br><br>“The messiah can be difficult.” The woman said, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “He is young still, and he needs help adjusting to his role.” Here, only here, the woman’s stone softened into something like fondness. “Please be patient with him.”<br><br> <br><br>So Yuumei met Northrend, their alleged messiah. He stood crouched on the edge of a precipice, lit by the sun from behind, so far above Yuumei that she couldn’t quite make out his face.<br><br>The woman left them without introduction.<br><br> <br><br>Northrend was the most infuriating man Yuumei had ever met. It would haunt her once she realized, after it was too late, that at that time he had been trying to be better. Northrend trying was like someone normal doing their utmost to be intolerable. If she had known, she would reason, then she could have helped him. But from the beginning she treated him as his behaviour merited. Yuumei did not indulge people whose continued existence shattered her worldview. Humbleness and patience were not favoured traits of a High Priestess.<br><br>He acted like he had never spent a significant amount of time around other humans. No, it was worse than that. He acted as though no one else existed. As though he himself was not human. It wasn’t a question of empathy – it was acknowledgement. He did not hold eye contact. He did not even face the people to whom he spoke. Sometimes he would walk from a conversation to chase a small animal, which he would proceed to eat raw. He disgusted her.<br><br>Yuumei had suffered the trials to become High Priestess and emerged victorious, bathed in the blood of her fellow candidates. She had been given stone walls and hours of memorisation and a family that no longer recognized her. She had dedicated her life to interpreting the songs, hoping that one day she would meet the foretold messiah and help guide him on his quest. Yuumei had not minded living in the abbey because she had undertaken it with righteous purpose. The path had appeared more meaningful than the subsistence life of her parents. She looked at Northrend and wondered why she had left the little farmhouse with her sister and their chickens.<br><br>“The solstice.” Yuumei explained for the fifth time, furiously gripping Northrend’s arm so he could not escape. “At the summer solstice you have to stop Sin. It’s foretold. Surely you know the songs.” She was talking about the Song of Sin, the Song of Saving, the Song of Silence.<br><br>“Syra,” Northrend started, and Yuumei flinched because you didn’t Name someone like that, certainly not an angry God. It was inviting ruin. “Can do what he likes.”<br><br>“Thousands will die.” She considered slapping him but couldn’t convince herself to blaspheme. The undying woman had called this man the messiah. “Thousands.” The songs said that he would be noble. The songs lied. “You can stop it. It’s your duty.”<br><br>“<em>On summer solstice, his moment will come / Thousands will be saved, great evil undone</em>.” Northrend sang softly, sweetly. Of course he chose the Song of Saving. Yuumei wondered who had taught him. He had been taught, of that much she was certain. “The songs say that they will be saved. I do not need to do anything.”<br><br>Yuumei felt trapped by his fatalism. It would be against the doctrines to disagree. But if he did nothing, she was certain that the songs would not come to pass, regardless of their alleged certainty. The thought was sacrilegious and she did not care. She looked at him, mud smeared across his cheek, eyes scanning the treeline. He was always looking at the horizon. Someone needed to explain to him that it did not get closer as you approached; that no matter how far you ran you couldn’t run from yourself.<br><br>This could not be their saviour. The thought repeated and she sighed deeply. The sound awoke something rusted and ancient in him. He caught her gaze for a moment. Was that agony, behind his eyes? Something burned.<br><br>“Does my presence mean that much to you?” His voice caught, as though he was scared. But why would he be scared of his high priestess? She was bound to serve him, regardless of his decisions, which was detestable and unfair but unfortunately ironclad. Otherwise, she would have left him long ago to return to her grand empty cathedral and turbulent court.<br><br>She supposed that this was the point in the conversation where she was to reassert his importance. But Yuumei was proud. She would not reinforce Northrend’s conceitedness.<br><br>“You have to follow the song.” Yuumei said coldly, refusing to engage with whatever Northrend was talking about. “It’s how you save the world.” She had a most terrible idea. He did want to save the world, didn’t he? Didn’t he? She thought about how he didn’t eat, how he looked down from the edges of cliffs like most people looked at altars.<br><br>They were all going to die.<br><br>“The Song of Saving killed my mother.” Northrend’s voice lacked anger, or grief, or much of anything. He did not blink. Uncanny. “One day it’s going to kill me. Forgive me if I don’t feel inclined to follow Syra’s orders.”<br><br>“You don’t care.” It was not a question. Yuumei had never felt dread like this before. It was like standing in the centre of her grand cathedral as the gods pulled its roof down on her head and placed little fires all around her. “You would kill us all.”<br><br>“No, Syra would kill you all.” Northren’s glare <em>burned</em>. “I don’t have that power.”<br><br>She laughed, then, tears in her eyes, on her cheeks, running down her neck. Her lungs felt that they might burst. Hesitantly, Northrend folded his arms around her in an imitation of an embrace. She did not flinch away.<br><br>She could not remember the last time she had been held. It felt warm.<br><br> <br><br>They travelled together, their objective unclear, their mutual frustration growing.<br><br>Northrend was incomprehensible. The more she tried to understand him, the better she came to know him, the less sense he made to her. He was singular like you would expect a messiah to be, remarkable too; there was no one like him. But instead of focusing on his duty, or on his own welfare as was normal, Northrend was obsessed with spite.<br><br>She had not known such toxicity could inhabit a mortal. It was like what she read about Sin, only worse, because by now she knew that Sin came by sometimes to abduct Northrend and try to convince him to save them all. He had explained to her that Sin was forcing him to spend time with her, hoping she could persuade him to play along. Yuumei did not know what to believe anymore.<br><br>One thing was certain: the songs weren’t inevitable and the gods weren’t infallible. His very existence pried away her faith like chiselling a limpet from a rock, because Syra the Doombringer was more invested in humanity’s continued survival than their alleged messiah.<br><br> <br><br>The solstice was nearing. In the Song of Saving, Northrend saved everyone there from an unspecified threat. It was a turning point. But he was determined not to attend.<br><br>At the beginning, Yuumei had tried bargaining. Then pleading, threatening. When none of them worked, she turned her attention elsewhere. She tricked him. It wasn’t particularly difficult. She just changed the route. They couldn’t go directly and encounter pilgrims. Instead, they wound through the mountains, a treacherous road no one would voluntarily take. Yuumei knew they would be safe. As Northrend had put it, Sin wouldn’t let them die.<br><br>Northrend had a wonderful Gift – the purification of water – which he reduced to a selfish tool of survival. Sometimes, she wondered if the Gift was why he had been chosen – it said in the Song of Saving that the Messiah had the Gift to ‘cleanse and make right’ – but surely there was more to the selection than that? It helped them travel. Yuumei ate what people would give her when they saw her amulet of office, and when that didn’t work she tried demands with mixed results.<br><br>While Yuumei dug pits for her waste and cooked food, Northrend scampered off at dusk and came back with blood around his mouth. She found herself unable to look him in the eyes. His honesty terrified her.<br><br> <br><br>Eventually, they reached the festival site. She could not conceal their destination from Northrend any longer. Still, he followed her, reluctantly, cringing away from the noise of people celebrating and singing, sticking closely to her side.<br><br>Paper flags hung between poles. A group of people were playing instruments, one violin rose above the others, a crooning wail that struck Yuumei in the core. Around them was a swirl of fabric, people dancing on the longest night of the summer. Children weaved around their feet, some wearing animal masks, others grinning through face paint. A resonance rose from the scene, something sticky and sweet, ringing through the air like smoke.<br><br>It warmed her. She felt a momentary pang of grief for the person that had died when they took her to live in the grand cathedral. She had never known such joy existed right outside her entombment. Off to her left, two young lovers held hands, grinning into each other’s mouths. That, too, stirred a strange longing in Yuumei. She turned her head away, casting her gaze onto Northrend who had gone oddly still.<br><br>“See?” Yuumei told him, eyes sparkling with a combination of grief and love. “People are worth saving. Look at this. This is what we can have together.” Her mind carried on without her consent, weaving a fantasy of the two of them living in a cottage on the edge of the woods he loved so dearly. They could have chickens, or goats. As much as she hated him, in that moment Yuumei felt something fragile bloom underneath the hatred, something like longing.<br><br>“He wants me to make a speech and hold a sword. He wants me to pretend to kill him.” Northrend was oddly calm, for once looking into Yuumei’s eyes, his anxiety from the crowd suddenly abated. “And I said I’d do it, I promised. On my mother’s grave. But I can’t.”<br><br>“There’s a stage over there.” Yuumei murmured encouragingly. “You can give a speech from there. If you would like, first we could dance.” Something warm rose in her at the thought. His hand felt hot in hers.<br><br>“I won’t.” Northrend said, staring at the stage, something feral in him coming utterly unmoored. “I’m not- my name is Neraverine.”<br><br>Yuumei tilted her head, surprised by the sudden intimacy of the moment. You couldn’t lie about a Name. And that was his Name – she felt it, as one always did with Names. But it wasn’t Neverine the Messiah. There was an extra syllable in there, casting the word into shadow. She wondered, fleetingly, if she should offer her own Name in return.<br><br>“It means Equal-Opposite-Force.” Was that weary resignation in his voice? Or determination? She could never read him well. “When you push, the universe pushes back. When you push me, I will push back just as hard. When you hurt me, you will hurt just as much.”<br><br>“I am not Hope’s reflection.” Northrend looked through her. “I am the mirror and I will not be what he made me.”<br><br>Worry twisted in Yuumei’s chest. He dropped her hand and strode towards the stage. She moved to stop him, but the crowd kept her back. Even pushing, she could not catch up, and then he was ringing a large bell and all heads were turning, lighting up with wonderment. Someone, presumably this God Northrend always spoke of, put a light behind him. His eyes seemed to glow, to get bigger, and against her consent Yuumei became awed by the divinity of him. She could, finally, envision him as a saviour instead of another grubby human. This was deception. Anyone who had met Northrend knew there was no holiness in him.<br><br>He said nothing. The crowd held their breath, eyes full of wonderment. All waited for him to speak. Dread pooled in Yuumei’s stomach. When he opened his mouth, she knew it would be awful, and she knew she could not stop him.<br><br>“No one can be saved.” The wildness in him reared forwards. Suddenly, the light extinguished. A cloud passed over the sun and then the air turned red.<br><br>All around her, Yuumei heard the inhalations as people realized that they were about to die. Not because of disaster, or disease, but because the man who had been ordained to save them had deemed them unworthy of being saved. For spite, these people would die. Yuumei could see children, scared, holding onto the sleeves of their parents, and she seethed, thinking of her own small fingers being peeled from her mother’s arm.<br><br>“Northrend.” Yuumei shouted above the crowd, desperate and powerless, wishing as she had never wished before that she could take his place in this farce. “Pain is real. Death is real. There are children.” <em>This is bigger than God,</em> she wanted to say, <em>this is about people</em>. “This is not about principles. This is about not… not being a murderer. You have to- you have to-”<br><br>“No.” It was absolute. Northrend did not falter.<br><br>With a scream, Yuumei launched herself at him with renewed vigour.<br><br> <br><br>The rest of the night was hazy. She could only handle recollecting it in staccato, disconnected images. There was blood. Viscera. The scent of intestines bursting and faeces hitting the air. A look on Neraverine’s face as he stood above it all: something adjacent to triumph, something parallel to disgust. Ugly grief poured out of him, like water overflowing a full basin, as though he had no space for the suffering in front of him in addition to his own. Yuumei was spared no such mercy.<br><br> <br><br>There was no way of describing how it happened, or what happened. It just did. And, for some unknown reason, it did not happen to Yuumei, nor Neraverine.<br><br> <br><br>If there was any justice or tenderness in the world, if one human had ever been kind to another, if Yuumei’s mother had ever held her, his hatred would have obliterated him instead of all these faithful people coming together to celebrate the solstice. It did not. And Yuumei knew, then, in the eye of the storm, that there was nothing in or beyond this world worthy of her devotion.<br><br> <br><br>She curled around a small child calling for their mother. They turned to liquid in her arms, splashing her face with pulped skin. It was nothing she could recognize as formerly human.<br><br> <br><br>An elderly man clung to Neraverine’s leg, dying. Their alleged messiah kicked him away.<br><br> <br><br>There was an arm. It was small. Young. Unattached. It hit Yuumei in the side. She vomited. The air was heavy with blood mist, red and unbreathable. Pieces of people thudded to the ground around her. The liquidated child clung to the front of her shirt in thick clumps.<br><br> <br><br><em>I am High Priestess of nothing</em>. Yuumei remembered thinking. <em>There is no Hope</em>.<br><br> <br><br>The only way away was through. Northrend gripped her limp hand and dragged her through the thigh-high viscera, some of it moaning, crying, pleading. All of it beyond her help. All of it dying, or dead. Her estranged family could be among them.<br><br>Yuumei had not known there could be so much suffering in the world. She saw bone and nerves hitting air. She saw the exact moment death swallowed the faith of a pious crowd. Humans were gristle and bone and meat. Banal and fragile creatures. She wept until she could no longer weep. Still, Northrend dragged her through and away from the massacre. But it was on her and in her. There would be no walking away from this. She would carry it until she died, the pall it was wrapped in occasionally slipping as she remembered again what it looked like when Northrend’s mask of humanity slipped away.<br><br> <br><br>Once he had led her from that terrible place, she jerked her hand away from his and crouched on the floor. Her face was wet. She stank of blood.<br><br>He tried to say something to her. She screamed in response.<br><br> <br><br>Eventually, later, she slept.<br><br> <br><br>She woke up with Northrend holding a knife to her throat. She grabbed it by the blade on instinct, relishing the pain as it cut into her palm, and shoved him away. Her body still shook with adrenalin. He was emaciated as always and did not fight back. Subduing him was easy – too easy. He lacked conviction. It was odd, since everything else she had seen him do, including ordaining thousands to die, had been done without a trace of hesitation.<br><br>Why had she thought worshipping this man was a good idea? There was nothing here worth staying a moment longer. She would leave, as she should have left the moment she laid eyes on him.<br><br>“You don’t understand.” Northrend sounded worse than she had ever heard him. She glanced back. Why did he look so desperate?<br><br>“You tried to kill me.” She stopped walking. Did he have an explanation? She hoped he didn’t so she could leave with more certainty. She did not mention the previous night’s events, uncertain she could bear to hear his excuses, as though anything could justify <em>that</em>.<br><br>“I almost loved you.” He looked wistful. “And that’s not safe. Not for you, not for me. You don’t know what Syra would do to you. So I tried to protect you.”<br><br>Yuumei did not want to think about what Northrend was saying, about what he had survived that had planted the conclusion that saving someone could be killing them. He was rot and she wanted to excise him from her life with a hot knife. She was so tired of trying to understand him, of trying to persuade him, of almost coming to know who he really was only to find out that it had been another layer of shield, like an onion. He was rotten, through and through, and if she didn’t leave then he would kill her. He had already tried.<br><br>He would never apologize for this. He would never think it was wrong. That was how he was – a wildfire, destroying everything without apology or forethought. There was no malicious intent, no understanding of the damage he did, and there never would be. Yuumei was the Living Emissary of Hope and even she was not arrogant enough to believe she could change him. A brief memory of the day before washed across her vision and she whimpered, covering her eyes, wishing she had never left her cathedral.<br><br>“You would rather kill me than lose your stand-off against Sin. This isn’t about protecting me – it’s about your pride. Your pride is bigger than this entire planet. It will smother us all. I hope you die. I wish I had never met you.” Yuumei’s voice was shaking. “Never come near me again.”<br><br>Yuumei ran from the monster, all the while thinking that it was over, the evil lived in her now, there was no escaping the world that allowed this terrible thing to happen. When she could not run, she walked until she could again, and then started the sprint anew.<br><br>Eventually, a day’s travel from inhumanity in human skin, she sank into a restless sleep once more. Her dreams were red.<br><br> <br><br>Yuumei’s eyes opened to opaque white. For a moment, she thought herself dead. Then a wave of cold hit her.<br><br>She sat up, tendrils of fog sliding from her skin, opening her mouth to exhale the thick mist. The blank sheet of cloud reached up to her neck. Ahead, she could trees protruding for a few meters. Light pale rain cast the remainder of the world into shadow.<br><br>Shivering, Yuumei wrapped her arms around her torso. This position was indefensible, at once exposed and obscured. Neraverine could find her. She felt the spectre of cold steel against her neck, raised her hand to her throat and touched the crusted blood. She would not wait to be killed.<br><br>Stumbling to her feet, Yuumei started to advance through the forest. She had no way of orienting herself. She was fortunate that she had no destination in mind. Any church would recognize her amulet of office and provide an adequate space to gather herself. There was one advantage to being high priestess. Squinting ahead, Yuumei had to remind herself that there would be an end to the trees. Forests were finite. The scent of violets hung in the air.<br><br>Yuumei flinched when she spotted a silhouette ahead, standing perfectly still in the fog. For a moment, she considered running, but as she crept closer she realized that it could not be Neraverine. It was a woman – thin, frail, oddly familiar, somehow ageless. Taking care to move more quietly then the rustling leaves surrounding them, Yuumei began to recognize the figure. It was the woman who had unleashed Neraverine on Yuumei – the one who had guided Yuumei’s hands to stab her heart cleanly through and risen again.<br><br>“Ah, Yuumei.” Yuumei jumped, having assumed herself unseen. She did not throw her Name around. In fact, she was fairly confident that there was no one breathing to whom it was known. Upon hearing it spoken, she wondered if she were dead. “The High Priestess of Hope in these turbulent times.”<br><br>“I am the High Priestess of Hope.” Yuumei affirmed warily. She did not insist that she was Nameless; it was not strictly true. She could not remember this woman’s name.<br><br>“I used to be a High Priestess too. Not of Hope, of Syra.” Yuumei’s eyes opened wide at the God’s Name. You did not Name a God, not casually, certainly not without intent to invoke their wrath. “You know him now as Sin.” The woman continued. Her voice was melodic, flowing. She spoke as though to tell a story to the air, not to address someone standing in front of her, without pause and with practiced ease. “Hope didn’t have a church at that time.”<br><br>“Who are you?” Yuumei whipered. She pressed her nails into her palm and reeled when she did not awaken. The woman ignored her.<br><br>“In the course of my duties, I threw myself onto a sword to defend him. I thought I loved him.” The stranger moved and Yuumei stepped back, expecting a blow. But she just pulled up her shirt. Underneath, slicing across her breast, was a keloid scar, unmistakably a sword wound slicing through her side and into her heart. She turned, showing the similar scarring on her back. There was no mark where Yuumei had stabbed the woman. Was this other scar… older? A wound like that was not survivable.<br><br>Yuumei took another step back, dreadfully certain that this was the afterlife. “As the sword struck through me, my flesh stayed warm and my blood kept flowing. He came to me, then. Syra used to walk more freely around this world. He cupped my cheek.” The woman stepped forwards as Yuumei’s back hit a tree trunk, raising a hand to Yuumei’s cheek in the ghost of an ancient embrace. The smell of violets was unmistakable now and thicker than the fog. It became hard to breathe.<br><br>“I bled on him. I wanted to apologize for it, as though the entire endeavour had not been in his service. As though… as though my blood did not already belong to him.” The stranger chuckled bitterly, her breath hot and sweet against Yuumei’s face. “He told me that I had wasted my life because no mortal could harm him. But, he said he respected my devotion. That was enough for me: my heart bloomed. It was everything I had ever wanted: to die for my God and become a song. I would honour my church and become a saint.”<br><br>“Who are you?” Even now, in mortal terror, Yuumei’s voice rang as clearly as a bell.<br><br>“But I did not die.” The woman ignored Yuumei’s question. “The blood kept flowing. Eventually, Syra left me encircled by the spearheads of my enemies. My church sang about me, while they endured. They called me the Reborn, the Unmartyred, the Abject… but those songs are long forgotten. Some people might consider that the beginning of this story.”<br><br>“Who are you?” Yuumei repeated, louder. “Why are you here? How do you know my Name? Am I dead?”<br><br>“Ah, that I would be permitted entry to the Veil. No. I am Leun: the Witness, the Deathless, the Unsung. I suppose that I am the closest thing Neraverine has to a mother.” There was a twist to the last word, a small joke. Then Leun’s face straightened and she took on a dark intensity. ”I am here to speak as one Priestess to another, on this mortal plane. Do you know why Syra sang his dark song? The Song of Saving?”<br><br>“It was Hope who sang that song.” This was the most basic of truths, the bedrock of Yuumei’s dwindling faith<em>.</em> “She did it to save us from Sin’s Curse.”<br><br>“Is that what they’re saying these days?” There was a faint smile on the woman’s face. “I was there. I remember. Hope came for me, she lifted me from my fifth witch pyre that moon phase, baptized me in violets and Named me Leun, in the process obliterating what my mother had Named me beyond memory. She told me that she made me deathless for my devotion to her brother and told me to watch over him for her because she could not inhabit the World forever. Her true face annihilated my physical form. By the time I woke up and washed the ashes out of my eyes, it was time to start navigating immortality alone.” The woman hesitated. “Do not tell Neraverine what I have told you. He would not yet understand.”<br><br>“I left Neraverine.” Yuumei struggled to understand what this woman was saying, still uncertain if this was a dream. “He…” It was so ridiculous that it was difficult to put into words, the destructive fusion of spite and stubbornness behind Neraverine’s actions. “He tried to kill me.” It was easier to say that than to say that their messiah wanted the world dead.<br><br>“I am sorry, Yuumei.” Leun said, her eyes looking past the fog. “He is difficult. You have to understand, he did not have many choices in this. Not a puppet either, despite Syra’s best attempts.”<br><br>Yuumei was tired. She had spent months catering to a beast who repaid her kindness with attempted murder. It had brought her to the brink of atheism. In an attempt to guard her faith, Yuumei had left him. But there was more to it than that, and now the nuance began to seep through the cracks of her mind. Because despite his godly title, despite hers, both of them were just people. She called him wildfire, called him animal, called him messiah, but he was like her. And if Neraverine was a person, who could help his nature, who had no knowledge or experience fundamentally beyond her own, <em>why was he like that? </em>How could anyone <em>be like that?</em><br><br>“Neraverine is rancid.” The word was too small. Any word would be inadequate. To communicate it, she would have to show someone what had happened the night of the solstice, and then have them wake up with a knife to their neck. “Sin the Doombringer affords our lives more value.”<br><br>“Syra is God of the World.” Leun told Yuumei gravely. “He values your lives more than any mortal could. To annihilate the World would be to annihilate himself. That is one of the reasons he will not succeed.” Leun saw the confusion in Yuumei and sighed. “Listen, Yuumei, your faith did not get everything right. Trust me on this. Hope is not worthy of your worship.” Leun’s face contorted for an infinitesimal moment into pure disgust. “She is incapable of noticing it. But if you pray to Syra, he may listen.”<br><br>“Why would I pray to the embodiment of evil?” Yuumei asked, voice quaking with rage, much of it directed at Neraverine, a little of it at this strange, clouded world and its uninvited denizen.<br><br>“Syra is God of the World.” Leun repeated intensely. “Syra belongs on this plane. He made you and will one day unmake you. He is our Progenitor. Hope is God of the Veil. She does not belong on the World. This song, Neraverine, your faith, all of it is theatre to invoke her. It would be best for us all did he not succeed.”<br><br>Yuumei shook her head, raising her hand so her fingertips lightly brushed her temple. The cloying scent of violets was distracting her. She considered fleeing. This incident could be easily written off as a half-lucid daydream because it was indistinguishable from one, and the woman’s ramblings made little enough sense for the option to be attractive. But, here and there, between swathes of cloud, Yuumei felt the static stirrings of truth. Something closer to truth than her predecessors had recorded in the holy texts that she had sung in her great cathedral.<br><br>This woman was ancient. This was as evident as fire is hot. But she was also static, atrophied somehow, as though she were missing something indefinable and essential.<br><br>The spiritualism of the experience was taking root. Yuumei felt her mouth drifting open, momentarily considering the notion of Neraveine as a speck of grit, soon to be swaddled in her nacre, ready to be transformed into a shining pearl…<br><br>“No.” Yuumei said aloud, thinking of the same word leaving Neraverine’s mouth. “Neraverine is human.” She was aware, suddenly, of the pettiness of her hatred in the face of cosmic events. But she knew she was right. “And he’s awful. I don’t…” She thought, about how Neraverine had thwarted the Song of Saving. “At the Solstice, he let them die.” Her hands were fists. The air was blood mist. She could smell viscera and death and agony. “Sin killed them. How can you say he loves everything in the World when he works to destroy it?”<br><br>“It’s theatre, a story. Syra does not truly intend to destroy the world, only to make a show of destroying it. You see?”<br><br>Yuumei saw nothing but white incomprehensibility. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up and she straightened, thinking about the face of an elderly man who had died in the solstice clinging to Neraverine’s feet, the moment he had realized that his messiah chose not to save him. She shook her head.<br><br>“I will put this so you can understand, Yuumei. Syra-” Yuumei shivered as Leun uttered the Name of a God and Leun tilted her head, reconsidered. “Sin has… a sister. He loves her like mortals do their kin. As for the World… he loves the World like mortals love their gardens. You understand? They are both loved greatly, but one love subsumes the other.”<br><br>Yuumei nodded, blinking and reopening her eyes to the thin woman in the fogbound forest. This was real. She understood that. This was true.<br><br>“Sin threatens to burn his garden to entice his sister to return. She is… a missing part of him that he loves dearly. He knows that she chose to leave and could choose to return. He intends for this to persuade her.”<br><br>“Are you his sister?” Yuumei asked.<br><br>Leun laughed. “I am a shadow. Once a mortal, now not even that. His sister… well, you could say that she created me to serve in her place. I am a poor substitute.”<br><br>“Why won’t she come back, whoever she is?”<br><br>“No one knows why The-Wheel-That-Breaks-All turns.” Leun paused, scrutinizing Yuumei’s face, searching for understanding. “Sin’s sister is your God, High Priestess. She abandoned this world millennia ago and Sin, in his unfulfilled dependency, has finally gone mad for it.”<br><br>“Hope is gone?” Yuumei thought about warm sunlight through the vibrant chapel windows. She thought about her devotion, her sacrifices, her endless patience with the monster that was Neraverine. “Where has she gone?”<br><br>“Beyond the Veil, into Sakharek’s domain. The Void. Your faith calls it…” Leun ruinated for a moment. “Heaven. Or hell. It is both and neither. She is the God of the Veil: the Gatekeeper, the Boatman, the Reaper… I forget which moniker your church gives her. You pass through the Veil by her grace when life leaves you.”<br><br>“But… why? Was… our worship insufficient?”<br><br>“Your worship was irrelevant. It is a farce created by Sin, the latest in a long string of attempts to entice her back. She left because she wished it, and she does not return because she wishes it. As to why… there is no answer we can understand. The Wheel has always will always turn.” Leun lowered her face. “I see her, sometimes. In the face of a starving child, stomach swollen, moments from death. In the moment the blade meets heart. She turns still…. Always turning…”<br><br>Faced with the bones of her theology, Yuumei shrank back. Hope was absent. The prophecy a farce. Still…<br><br>“Where is Neraverine in this?”<br><br>“Neraverine is a wild dog who only knows how to bite. He was bred and trained to follow a script. But he has proved himself incapable of doing so. Now, Sin is reacting to the mess he made.”<br><br>“I don’t…” Yuumei covered her face with her hands, moments from weeping. “What good is this? Why are you telling me this?” <em>Does it matter when it cannot be changed?</em><br><br>“There is no good in it. I am telling you, because to pass my message you must know its context. There are worse things than dying to a knife in the night.” Leun the Undying, the Aberrant, told Yuumei gravely. “But most importantly, Hope does not hear your prayers. Were you to stay in the World, I would urge you to reconsider your choice of deity.”<br><br>Yuumei fell silent, understanding the threat. She found herself incapable of fear – frozen, like a rabbit in torchlight. Leun could not be killed. What was Yuumei to do in the face of deathlessness? Her hand gripped her amulet of office – the Sapphire of Hope – her knuckles turning white. But she did not pray as she once would have. After meeting Neraverine, she was no longer capable of such a thing.<br><br>“I need you to send a message, Yuumei. She may listen to her own High Priestess, as little as she cares for mortals, especially if I bring you to the threshold personally. If I could take your place, I would. I envy you. But you need to take your anger, your mortal grievance and pass it to your God. You will only have a moment to inform her of the situation. I pray it will be enough.”<br><br>In an instant, Yuumei’s throat was held in Leun’s hands. Two eyes stared into her face, one green, one blue. Behind them static and apathy, nothing human, nothing familiar. The last thing she would see. Her hands scrabbled at her throat, but the thin woman was impossibly strong. Yuumei would die here, surrounded by the cloying stench of violets, glimpsing part of a truth she could not truly understand. It felt like a forgone conclusion, or a martyrdom.<br><br>Absurdly, Yuumei thought of the thatch hut of her birth, of all the things she left behind only to die here.<br><br>“Tell Hope- No. Tell <em>Saynu</em>,” The Name rang through Yuumei’s head like a siren. “What Syra has done here. Tell her he plans to drag Teyu into all this.” Yuumei’s vision began to swim. Without clarity, the swirls of white started to seem less like fog and more like holes in the World.<br><br>“Tell Saynu it’s time to come home.”<br><br>"

This was not unusual – most of the staff of Sin’s Stronghold were refugees without a history. However, as the days passed and she settled into the only place she had known, Teyu started to wonder if it was normal to feel like she had come into being a handful of moon-cycles earlier.<br><br>Her first memory was Sin’s fanged face protruding from his whirlwind of wings and eyes, telling her she was to serve him. <em>Syra</em>, her brain provided, but she did not speak the Name of the God before her, cowed by its preternatural scrutiny. He called her by her name, Teyu, and it revealed little about her past. The word glowed with <strong><em>HEAT LIGHT PRESSURE</em></strong> and if you looked closer, <strong><em>MASS</em></strong>. What this meant for her, she had no idea.<br><br>At first, she was given time to acclimatize. Teyu ventured through the labyrinth of Syra’s castle, stepping up to the threshold of each room but pausing there. Doorways felt dangerous, she disliked entrances and exits. On the rare occasions she could persuade herself to cross these boundaries, she gathered candles for her chamber and pilfered the kindling.<br><br>The air was always a biting cold. Even when Teyu crawled into the fireplace, her garments burning away, nesting in the ash, she shivered with the cold. The logs were uncomfortable. Instead, she nested herself with rings of candles, glowing and heating up until everything in her stone chamber burned. But the stone walls would never catch and the door was iron, so although she could melt it if she concentrated the heat into her palms, it would not feed the fire.<br><br>After a few days, there was nothing in her chambers but ash. The burning curtains had scorched then shattered the glass on the window, now leaving a freezing hollow. Sin brought her new clothes, instructed her not to burn them. Teyu gathered more candles and kindling to immolate herself, anything to drive off this biting cold. It grew worst at night when she would stare at the moon and want to cry, her eyes steaming, feeling a grief she could not understand.<br><br>“You’re mourning.” Sin observed one night, materializing outside her window. He always knew where she was and what she was doing. She had long stopped seeking an explanation for that.<br><br>Teyu did not respond, still scared of this God, but fearing equally the windowsill which constituted a type of doorway. He obscured the moon. The situation had her glowing in fear, sparks alighting across her skin, the floor beginning to smoke.<br><br>“Calm. I have a task for you, Teyu.”<br><br>Immediately after that visit, she was put to work in his dungeons. The prisoners called her the Wraith, because she appeared alight in the dark. Some mistook her for a ghost, which made her job as interrogator easier. Her affinity for heat and light was called a Gift, she eventually discovered. She could turn metal to liquid in her hands. It was unusually strong and it explained why Sin had chosen her, perhaps even why he had taken her identity. Power like hers was useful to control.<br><br>It didn’t feel like a force she could exert, or even a muscle. It was more like her identity, something honest burning through her haze of amnesia and fear. When she was on fire and staring at the moon, she almost remembered, and with the near-recollection came immersion in dread.<br><br> <br><br>While Teyu burned handprints into prisoners, dancing around a feeling of guilt and recollection, Sin changed. His wings flared and flexed in tight circles, his irises flashed from yellow to red to black. The aura of darkness around him grew, it began to seep out of him, and sometimes, when she blinked, Teyu could see something bigger and brighter hiding under the image she could see. This afterimage she began to expect was his true form was made from lichens, antlers, white mushrooms and cherry blossoms. It had branches in place of wings, parts of it developing legs and eyes, seeking to escape the main body.<br><br>Preceding Sin’s foul moods were screams and snarls echoing from the most secure cell in the dungeon. Teyu had walked past it. Even when she heard the occupant crying, the sobs were angry, almost hateful.<br><br>There were so many things that Teyu feared in this place. Between the constant thresholds she was forced to traverse and Sin’s watchful unpredictability, she found herself taking control of the only thing she could. Teyu stopped staring at the moon and started slicing into her prisoners, peeling away at their composure until she knew them utterly.<br><br> <br><br>One night, Sin visited her. He stood unnaturally still and when she glimpsed the second form beneath, she noticed that his blossoms had withered and parts of him were turning black. Her old fear abated slightly.<br><br>“I am sending you to handle Neverine, the Once-Messiah.” Sin flared his wings. Pride, maybe? Or anger? She shrank back instinctively. “Be careful.”<br><br>So, following instructions as always, afraid of the God that haunted her every step, Teyu found herself inside the most secure cell.<br><br>When Teyu first saw Northrend he was bleeding onto the floor. Sin had debriefed her – running in circles, a punishment he deemed ironic for a reason she didn’t understand, and when he stopped (<em>which he had to do</em>, Sin informed her gleefully, <em>because he couldn’t run forever</em>, and whatever history was behind those words was lost on her but the malice in his eyes wasn’t) he was eviscerated. Sin partially healed the wound before the next repetition.<br><br>Teyu was not used to this level of intensity. She could burn and slice, but she could not restore. It was important to skirt death. With Sin, there was no such limitation.<br><br>What Sin hadn’t told her, was that he had a broken leg. It wasn’t a fracture, nor a sprain – it was infected and brutal and she could see the bone, probably because he had been <em>running on it for over a week</em>. Northrend lay on the floor, bleeding, intestines partially gaping, one leg ruined to the point of amputation, wheezing. It was a harsh job – but her life was on the line. Sin said that if she didn’t do it exactly as described then she would become a prisoner herself, and he always knew. He was a God after all. Her primary job was to keep him awake. According to Sin, he hadn’t slept in a week.<br><br><em>What did he do</em>? Teyu wondered. <em>Why is he still alive?</em> She remembered other prisoners having called him their messiah, the one destined to fight Sin. But why? There had to be a reason for Northrend lying here with a gangrenous leg, looking nothing like a hero.<br><br>“Are you awake?” Teyu asked. She did not want to fail this task because she did not want to die.<br><br>Northrend mumbled something. It was too indistinct and quiet to catch.<br><br>“What did you say?”<br><br>“…Name…” Northrend insisted, urgent and terrible.<br><br>Something in Teyu twisted. The pain it must have caused him to speak… For the first time in her short existence, Teyu felt sympathy. She was unprepared for it and the feeling shattered any emotional distance she had drafted between them.<br><br>“I’m Teyu.” She spoke nakedly and without forethought. Immediately, she understood her mistake. You did not tell anyone your Name, even if they introduced you to the concept of empathy.<br><br>“’m Neraverine.” He said it slowly and carefully. “Not Neverine. Ne-ra-ver-ine.”<br><br>“Oh.” Did that mean that he wasn’t the foretold? She was at a loss for words.<br><br>“…kill…” Neraverine was cut off by coughs. Teyu waited for him to gather himself. “Do you know how to kill, Teyu?” His words were faltering and indistinct, but she caught them.<br><br>“Yes.” She knew what he was asking. He wouldn’t like her answer.<br><br>He coughed, or laughed. “Do you know how to obliterate?” There was something so hopeless in his eyes that she felt despair from being in his immediate proximity. “Do you know how to reduce me to something Syra can’t bring back?” Teyu flinched at his use of Sin’s Name. It was beyond unwise to Name a God, especially that one.<br><br>“No.” She wanted to, she realized. The rotting piece of meat before her shouldn’t have been alive. It was a violation of natural law. But she couldn’t and even if she could, she wouldn’t.<br><br>“Pity.” His expression didn’t falter at any point during the exchange. She wondered if it would be possible for him to feel worse, or better, in the physical state he was in.<br><br>Teyu left as soon as she could. The moment she was outside of the room, she vomited until she was retching up nothing but boiling acid.<br><br> <br><br>The amputation was a kindness and medical necessity. It wasn’t torture (torture was her burning him last night, and the night before – torture was when she gripped his exposed ulna in pliers and <em>pulled</em>) because there was no way he could notice a change in that… rotting meat attached to his hip. It was a shrivelled and fetid thing, swollen and black. The bone had been broken in at least six different places. It would have squelched if he had been able to move. Somehow, likely through divine magic, the nerves were still intact. It must have been excruciating. They rattled around uselessly. The muscles had been systematically pared from the bone, leaving the skin hanging in a hollow, empty sack. They had been left on the floor, but it seemed that Neraverine had eaten them out of desperation.<br><br>She didn’t think that even Sin could restore it after so much neglect and abuse. Even if he could, he didn’t want to. She still remembered the schadenfreude, the utter <em>triumph</em> in his face when he’d said that Neraverine would never run away again. It was like he’d wanted it more than anything.<br><br>When Neraverine saw Teyu approach with the white-hot bonesaw, his eyes went wide. He wheezed something incomprehensible and tried to back away, only he was too weak to even flinch convincingly. She watched in fascination as he jolted his broken bones in an attempt to roll away.<br><br>“It’s okay.” Teyu said comfortingly, wondering as she habitually did how Neraverine could still be alive. “It’s for your own good.” She’d never said that before about anything else she’d done to him, because it hadn’t been true. Honesty could be advantageous in interrogation. Only, this wasn’t interrogation because there was nothing Sin wanted from Neraverine but his pain.<br><br>She saw recognition light in his glassy eyes as his eyes skittered across the saw. He looked at her, trying to focus to see if she was looking at his leg, if she meant to take it from him.<br><br>He struggled to breathe deeply but his muscles failed him and all he could manage were short, sharp, terrified breaths. “Stop, Teyu.” He spat out the words through bone-dry lips, his gums black from dehydration. His entire body shook from the effort, eyes rolling in near unconsciousness.<br><br>Teyu stopped. She didn’t have a choice. This was why only the people you trusted absolutely knew your Name. It was the biggest taboo in their society, to force someone to do anything with their Name. Any reference to it was skirted in polite conversation, and even in threats only euphemistically referred to. Even in the stories, legends and songs, it was omitted by choice. The consensus was that no one did it. Maybe it didn’t even work. It was a weakness everyone did their best to forget. Teyu wouldn’t use it, and she was an interrogator.<br><br>It felt horrible, to have her agency stripped from her. She had always wondered what type of individual could hurt someone in that way. Apparently, that individual was their dying saviour. Teyu thought her way around the blockage. It took about fifteen minutes. Orders via Naming may have been unpleasant and powerful, but they were also short lived, especially a command as ambiguous as stop.<br><br>“Shut up, Neraverine.” She hissed. He opened his mouth and she reflexively burned him with the flat edge of the saw. It caught the front of his face and part of his collarbone. The fire didn’t catch – he was too damp with old sweat and blood – but it still wounded him. He wheezed, voice high, incoherent, warbling with inexpressible agony.<br><br>Later, she would realize that he had been able to ignore a Name command. And, as with all Names, she could tell that it <em>was</em> his Name. He must be exceptional in some respect for him to be able to shake off a command like it was nothing. His will must have burned through the ancient magic.<br><br>Trembling with violation, she heaved his leg into alignment and began to saw. After that he was too busy trying to scream to order her to do anything else.<br><br> <br><br>In her brief interludes between her sessions with Neraverine, Teyu sat on the windowsill wondering who she was and, worse, who she was becoming.<br><br>Sin was rotting. Neraverine was despicable. She didn’t quite understand what was wrong, but something was wrong, or maybe everything was wrong. She tried not to look at the moon but woke up feeling as though it was calling to her regardless. Then she would venture deeper into the castle, gathering candles, hoping to combust and properly burn next time she burst into flames, to become smoke and float away from this tired world.<br><br> <br><br>Teyu’s next task seemed bizarrely unfair. She wasn’t a doctor. Wasn’t even <em>nice</em>. She suspected that being assigned to Neraverine’s recovery was a punishment for them both. As Sin rotted, he grew more spiteful. These days, she was him exacting his wrath on any unfortunate enough to be near him.<br><br>At least Neraverine didn’t have to do anything but lie there. She had to somehow breathe life into the person she’d been systematically destroying for moons at Sin’s behest. She was assigned a medical professional to consult. A tired and unsympathetic man who was a prisoner himself. He told both Teyu and Sin in clear terms that if they wanted Neraverine to recover, it meant no violence, no distressing him, and for the love of Hope (Sin groaned at that name, as though he had been dealt a mortal wound) no more sleep deprivation.<br><br>“Otherwise he’ll break.” The doctor said firmly. “You may be able to stop it from killing his body, but you can’t stop it from killing his mind.”<br><br>Against expectations, Neraverine didn’t die or vegetate. He just endured.<br><br>When Teyu started to wipe at the layers of grime and blood, she was shocked by how much came off. Flesh meshed with fibre, black, some of it sliding away to reveal bone. There was even less of him than expected under the textured mass of blood clots and dirt. She wasn’t sure she could keep him from death in this state, but neither had any choice.<br><br>She wished there was a way for Neraverine to die without dragging her down with him.<br><br>Teyu was beginning to think that the holes in his body were the things stopping his recovery rather than his emotional state. Especially considering how consistently spiteful Neraverine managed to be. He deliberately aggravated his injuries in attempts to attack Teyu. At the beginning he was so weak that it was only a nuisance. After a few weeks she started to feel it, and before the moon was over she found her forearms gashed by his teeth and nails.<br><br>After Sin lost control when visiting Neraverine and mutilated the remains of his left leg, he abstained from further contact. Everyone saw that it was temporary. Even the doctor knew that they were helping him to recover so he could go another round.<br><br>Maybe next time he’d lose more than a leg. But even imagining him in a year, or ten, Teyu still couldn’t see his body as capable of enduring more abuse. Surely he would die, or collapse, or his mind would leave never to return. Then again, she’d felt that way when she’d first seen him, and things had become so much worse since then. He endured and he endured and he endured without respite nor end. He seemed to not understand what healing was, because he treated the process as yet another sufferance.<br><br>Neraverine detailed his status to Teyu, always trying to manipulate with guilt she was incapable of feeling. He detailed his injuries and sensations with a methodical thoroughness that required so much energy that it left her at a loss for words.  Whenever he could he tried to control her using her Name. Normally she could cut him off without violence, but occasionally she felt the alien tug of a command she couldn’t ignore. It felt like he was choosing to remain hurt, that he was avidly courting pain.<br><br>She wouldn’t hurt him against Sin’s orders no matter what he did, but she did begin to hate him. It was the first time she’d felt hatred for anyone.<br><br>“You taught me to hate.” She told him in a moment of weakness.<br><br>He crowed in triumph, wordless and absolute.<br><br>Considering that Teyu’s only real acquaintance was Sin, it was impressive that Neraverine, their alleged messiah, could surpass him so utterly in despicable behaviour. But, then again, she only needed to look at his wounds and scars to see where it had come from. And she had tortured him, had burned him and scarred him, (she suspected that the leg was at the heart of matters – that of all things, that was the loss he could never forgive her for) so why wouldn’t he treat her like the enemy? It was just the peculiar intimacy they held, the mutual use of true names, that muddied the water.<br><br>So Teyu nursed him and she despised him and guilt loomed over her like an absent threat without becoming disambiguous. The doctor sighed and shook his head until he was eventually reassigned. Sin stayed away, but rumour had it that he threw fits at the sound of Neraverine’s name, and each time Teyu saw the God more parts of him had rotted away.<br><br>The three of them circled each other without violence but equally without acceptance, waiting for the moment when the destruction would begin anew.<br><br> <br><br>Teyu knew the woman with different coloured eyes who smelled of violets. She was stooped and soft-spoken. Sin called her Witness, or Watcher. When Teyu had asked her name, the woman had said <em>Leun, </em>which was her Name, given freer than any should be. Teyu had stopped and stared. The woman had laughed, coldly, without amusement nor malice.<br><br>When Neraverine was at his nadir, when he shuffled into delirium with no concept for time nor space, he called out two names. One was Priestess. The other was Leun. But, although Teyu had seen Leun often around the castle, she had never seen the woman intervene on Neraverine’s behalf.<br><br>Leun spoke to Sin unlike anyone else. There was always fear in interactions with him. With Teyu, with anyone, even with Neraverine if you peered under the hatred. But not with Leun. She called him by his Name – Syra – inviting disaster that was never delivered. She had even openly criticized him. Stranger still, Sin cared what she thought of him. He explained himself to her, never gave her orders.<br><br>Who wore their name on their sleeve? Only heroes in the songs or Gods. But Sin was the last God on the World, and Teyu had seen too much of Neraverine to believe in heroes.<br><br>One night, Leun showed up at Teyu’s door. Curious as she was, Teyu let her in without thinking to alert Sin. It seemed that he was generally happy for Leun to come and go as she pleased.<br><br>“Hello, Teyu.” Leun said softly. She offered Teyu two candlesticks and a bundle of kindling.<br><br>Teyu started. She had never told Leun her name. “Did Sin..?”<br><br>“No.” Leun waved her hand dismissively, placing the gifts on the floor in front of Teyu. “I hear that you are in possession of one of two keys to Neraverine’s room.” Leun used his Name. Not the one Sin had given him, nor his use-name Northrend. It was strange.<br><br>“Yes.” She wouldn’t call it a room. Sin held the other key. She was due to see Neraverine in a few hours to give him water.<br><br>“I would like to visit him.” Leun’s face was serene.<br><br>Teyu blanched. Then she composed herself – this was an opportunity to learn about Leun. There was a small problem - Leun had come to Teyu instead of Sin. If he decided that this was a betrayal… well, she had perpetrated Sin’s idea of justice. She didn’t think she’d survive it.<br><br>Leun appeared to read her mind. “I am not afraid of Syra. There is nothing he can do to me that has not already been done to me a thousand times, and that will not be done to me a thousand times more.”<br><br>There was something so peaceful about Leun’s delivery, jarring against her ominous words. It was offputting, like putting your hand in a fire and getting frostbite. There was no explicit threat in the words, but Teyu felt danger encroaching all the same. She sucked in a deep breath and decided.<br><br>“Okay.” Teyu swallowed, her throat thick.<br><br>When they arrived, Teyu unlocked the door and hung back, eyeing the doorway with distrust. She strained to overhear their conversation, seeking leverage over Neraverine.<br><br>“Syra.” Neraverine hissed. Despite herself, Teyu felt a jolt of pride run through her body. He spoke using his diaphragm, not in the bloody wheeze he’d had until she started helping him recover. It was working. She tried not to think about what that meant for his immediate future.<br><br>“No, it’s Leun.” For once, she didn’t sound flat or unaffected. Was that… concern? Love? It was a warm thing, fragile and fluttering.<br><br>“You sound like her.” Longing? Or disgust?<br><br>“Did he take my image?”<br><br>“Of course.” That was the bitterness she knew well, overwhelming and corrosive, like the words burned his mouth.<br><br>“I will have to talk to him about that. How are you, little one?”<br><br>Neraverine laughed derisively. “If you’re here to help me, then you’re too late.”<br><br>“I’m not here to help you. Just to see you.”<br><br>“Then see me.” There was unmistakable hurt in his voice. He had been expecting rescue, Teyu realized. She pressed her ear to the door with so much force that it hurt.<br><br>“I remember when you were a child. I held you and sang the songs. You grew so much.” Leun mumbled something after that. It was in the lilting, poetic language Teyu had heard spoken by Sin, by Leun. The true speech in which you could not lie, from which Names were pulled.<br><br>“I hate the songs, and now I’m living one of them.” Neraverine said something else, also in the True Speech. The words left an unpleasant residue in the air. Teyu hadn’t realized that he could speak it. She wondered if some of the sounds she had thought unconscious groans had actually been words.<br><br>“I’m sorry, Neraverine. It will end.”<br><br>“I missed you, Leun.” The raw vulnerability in his voice was staggering. It was more than he’d shown Teyu in all of the time she’d tormented him, except for when she’d taken his leg. It unreal to hear his voice expressing an emotion other than rage, hatred or weariness.<br><br>“I missed you too.” Leun sounded like she was trying to imitate his tone. It wasn’t convincing, but it did have an underlying desperation that Teyu doubted was faked. She wanted him to know she loved him. “I left for a long time. I went to the site of the Solstice Festival, to the very place where you stood. I could not bear what would happen to you. I waited.”<br><br>“<em>You</em> couldn’t bear it?” The derision in his voice was explicit and venomous. “Leun, this is nothing new for me. The only part that was different was the frequency and intensity. And your absence.”<br><br>“I warned you where this path would lead.”<br><br>“It’s better than the alternative.” Neraverine sounded more like himself in that sentence: brimming with hatred.<br><br>“Perhaps I should have been here. But I have seen enough.”<br><br>“You’re Leun <em>the Witness, </em>Leun<em> the Watcher</em>. You’re supposed to see everything.”<br><br>“I am tired of watching. I will remember you for millennia to come. I did not need that memory to be of you drowned in suffering. I will try to remember you at your best.” Leun sighed. “I am sorry, but you are my child. I cannot bear to see you harmed this gravely.”<br><br>“Then stop me from being harmed this gravely!”<br><br>“You know that I can’t. There is nothing I could do that would dissuade Syra. I have tried.”<br><br>“I don’t want to see you right now.” Teyu heard a thump. She could image Neraverine inside, trying to walk away from the conversation and instead falling flat on his face. Irritation rushed through her – he wasn’t supposed to be moving around, and now he had delayed his recovery yet again. She didn’t know how much more time she could bear to be in the same room as Neraverine.<br><br>“There are many things I didn’t tell you.” Leun spoke awkwardly, like it was her second language, pausing between each word to carefully select the next. “Because Syra forbade it, and because you would have suffered for it. But he no longer cares. You outlasted his patience. I can answer your questions, little one.”<br><br>“It doesn’t matter why. I don’t care about his absent sister, or how the High Priestess died. I don’t even care about what made you the way you are. It’s too late. Nothing matters anymore. He took and I fought and he took and now we’re both too tired to learn how to do anything else. I have nothing left to give and he’s still taking.” His voice shook. “He’d never stop, not even if I stopped. We’re so far past the tipping point…” He laughed and Teyu winced, knowing how much it must have hurt his ribs to do so. “Everything will die. I don’t care why. It’s just me, him, our vandalized script, and eternity.”<br><br>“What about what will happen? Do you care about that?”<br><br>“I know what will happen. I’ll stay here and he’ll drag me out for set-pieces, and I’ll fight him because I’m not a puppet, I’m a mirror. Eventually, either he’ll destroy me too utterly to restore, or he’ll decide that it’s the end and I’ll exit stage left. They’re all the same ending. There difference is unimportant to me.”<br><br>“Neraverine, you are mistaken. You wriggled off his hook.” Was that… pride in Leun’s voice? “You ruined the Song of Saving beyond recovery.”<br><br>“I won?” It was the first time Teyu had heard Neraverine sound happy.<br><br>“If you can call it that. He forsook insurances against permeance. The apocalypse has begun in earnest. Syra, who made the World, has begun to unmake it.” She slipped, again, into the ancient language beyond Teyu’s ken. Neraverine replied and they conversed for some time, to Teyu’s frustration.<br><br>Eventually, Leun left. The following night, there were more candles on Teyu’s doorstep. Neraverine was different after that conversation, more hopeful.<br><br> <br><br>Teyu burned with her candles and kindling until it was time to see Neraverine. Sin’s orders had been clear – she was to take the other leg. As much as she hated him, the thought brought her no joy. So when she found Leun barring the exit to her chambers, Teyu did not shove past her.<br><br>“Thank you.” Teyu said instead, taking the proffered candles. Then she tilted her head to one side in wordless inquisition.<br><br>“You’re not human.”<br><br>“I didn’t stick my neck out and let you go see Neraverine to be insulted.” Teyu hissed, seething. Her clients had called her that before, several times. Inhuman. Monster. Teyu didn’t believe in such things. Humans had Gifts.<br><br>“Most humans have parents.” Leun observed dryly. “They also start life as children.”<br><br>“I know Sin took my memory.” Teyu’s eyes flashed. Leun was close to Sin. It was foolish to forget that she was dangerous.<br><br>“He took more than your memory. Tell me something, Teyu, have you heard of the Sun?”<br><br>Something vague tickled the back of her mind. A phrase? ‘<em>The Moon and Sun and Stars</em>.’ She knew the moon, the stars. Perhaps the Sun was the name for the brightest star? Or was it some other part of the nightly firmament? It must belong in the night, not the grey-black nothingness when all slept that lapped at the beginning and end of the night.<br><br>“Your face betrays you. The Sun was an immense orb of heat, pressure and light. It illuminated and sustained the World. It was far brighter than the moon. Without it, the World is withering, and with it withers the God of the World, Syra.”<br><br>Teyu did not remember the existence of such a thing. She waited for Leun to explain further.<br><br>“Before the Sun sustained the world, it was free and vast and enmeshed with its lover the Moon. The God Hope separated them by trapping them in her Veil. After that they chased one another, eternally, periodically casting the world into light and shadow.”<br><br>“I am… related to this Sun?” Teyu hesitated on the cusp of a realization that hurt.<br><br>“You are the Sun. For millennia, you were chained in the heavens. Then, in a moment of rage and loneliness, Syra bound you instead to one of his creations. A human, who was called Kyrlie. She is gone now. Instead, there is you. A hybrid of old God and human. As I explained, in your absence, the World dies. Currently, Sin is caught in a spiral of despair, so he continues to hold you here. But eventually the pain will be too great. He will return you to your celestial prison, recover, and forget this foolish endeavour he called the Song of Saving.”<br><br>Teyu, thinking of the pull she felt to the moon, the grief it awoke in her, felt that her missing memory was something terrible. An eternity of suspension, pressed between Void and Veil like a pinned insect, falling towards her lover and never reaching her.<br><br>“I don’t want to be hung in the sky.” She whispered it. Against the power she felt in Sin, the fear ingrained deeply into her of this other God of the Veil, she was not certain there was a choice in this.<br><br>Leun gave her a crooked smile lacking sincerity. “He cannot hang you in the sky if he cannot find you. He grows weaker each day. If you were to stay near Neraverine, the resonance between you would mask you both.”<br><br>“And what then? If I were to run and hide, what would come next?”<br><br>“If you evaded discovery for long enough, Syra would grow too weak to bind you. Then the World would die. The Veil would weaken in turn and the Moon would be unchained. All would dissolve into a miasma and you would be limitless once more.”<br><br>“This is something you intend for? You would facilitate that? Why?”<br><br>“Because of a curse set upon me by the God of the Veil, I am to endure for as long as this world does.” A crease appeared between Leun’s eyes. “I am not like you. I wasn’t made to last this long. I am… tired. This is the only way I will find my rest.”<br><br>Leun took Teyu’s heated hand in her own cool grasp and led her down a flight of stairs. As they walked, Leun continued. Teyu was still trying to process what she had already heard.<br><br>They were inside Neraverine’s cell before Teyu registered that they had left her chamber.<br><br>“My child.” Leun soothed, crouched besides Neraverine, almost singing. “There is a place where the Veil is thinnest. It is inaccessible to Syra by design. But… perhaps… you could find an answer there.” Leun put her hand on Neraverine’s cheek, her face twitching, as though desperate to show love but uncertain it dwelled within. “If you can talk to… Perhaps you can survive this. I want you to survive this.”<br><br>They were both crying. Teyu looked away, uncomfortable with her intrusion, unclear where she stood in all this.<br><br>“Find the White Spire. It lies west. You will see it jutting from the horizon long before you near it.” Leun stroked Neraverine’s hair. “Perhaps there you can find something to aid you. Teyu will take you. I will distract Syra.”<br><br>It was not Teyu’s body that crouched and hooked her shoulder under Neraverine’s arm. It also wasn’t her that raised him to his feet and limped towards the terrifying exit. She watched herself move him as silently as possible, blacking out the moment her figure left the stronghold that was all she had ever known.<br><br> <br><br>Teyu came back to herself in pieces. The body was still walking with Neraverine. She felt as though something was amiss, but that was normal. Groaning, she pressed her fingers to her forehead.<br><br>“Does it feel strange, travelling with me?” Neraverine asked, seemingly noticing that she was awake. His smile was crooked and she had no doubt that he was feeding off her discomfort.<br><br>“I still hate you.” Teyu closed her eyes tightly. She was starting to wonder if she felt as others did, being what she was. “And you still hate me.”<br><br>“I never hated you, Teyu.” Neraverine suddenly sounded weary. “I hurt you when you hurt me, with equal force and opposite direction. Leun always said that hurting people hurts yourself. I don’t know if that’s true. But, for you, with me, it was. You could have left at any time. I was the one who was trapped.”<br><br>Teyu could not think what to say. She knew it was true and this truth wounded her, almost mortally. She was not sure the human she had once believed herself to be existed any longer. Without the aberrant death grip of Sin’s stronghold, she was becoming something else. Thoughts came slowly to her and she wondered if the human part of her was starting to be burned away by the fire lurking beneath.<br><br>Hand trembling with muscle weakness he would never recover from, Neraverine brought out a glimmering golden necklace from under his shirt. It had a lonely sapphire set in the middle.<br><br>“This belonged to the last person I travelled with. She hated me. I couldn’t hate her. Syra gave it it to me after he killed her.” He paused. “It’s called the Sapphire of Hope.”<br><br>The name rang hollow. There were no sunbeams to make the jewel glimmer. In this grey light, against this broken landscape, it seemed a drab sad thing. Teyu thought it should be called the Sapphire of Grief, for the uncharacteristically sombre expression it induced in Neraverine.<br><br>The conversation died. Teyu kept her eyes out for this White Spire Leun had described.<br><br> <br><br>The air became stiller once the pillar started looming on the horizon. It was strange because in this sunless twilight where Teyu was no longer strung up above this World for their warmth, the air was often still and the sky always grey. But still, the Moon span. Teyu felt a longing when looking upon the Moon, a hunger to cherish and devour. The intensity of this feeling surpassed all others. The longer she spent staring at it, the less Teyu remembered.<br><br>Despite the World’s regularity under Sin’s pall, it became quieter and absolutely windless as they approached the rock formation Leun had described.<br><br>Teyu did not know how long the journey took. They travelled by moonlight. Neraverine required constant rest even after the effort Teyu had put into helping him through recovery for all those nights. But, at least, he no longer described his pain to her, nor wielded her Name to command her. The revelation of the necklace had been some kind of offer of trust. Teyu was trying not to be cruel, so she had accepted it.<br><br>She supposed that they were on the same side now. For whatever that was worth.<br><br>The stark White Spire daggered the sky, a sharp pillar of pale rock of unnatural formation. At its base, there was a hollow, barely large enough for a human to crawl into. Besides that, three dead trees encircling a hovel. They branches were pointed inwards towards the hut, as though mid-attack.<br><br>Neraverine ignored it, continuing towards the Hollow. It was easy for Teyu to keep pace, even as he moved as quickly as he could with the crutches and single leg. He let himself fall in front of the hollow and started to crawl inside, breathing hard at the exertion.<br><br> <br><br>Teyu considered his retreating form until it vanished completely. She wondered why she had listened to Leun and come here. There had been a reason, but that reason had been eclipsed by the beautiful moonlight.<br><br>Everything felt distant and cold. Her consciousness had left her, in its place was brutal fire. She was content, to sit and burn and yearn. Turning from the World, she cast her eyes to the moon. It felt familiar, to be trapped in a space too small, looking at something that she felt she would die if she did not reach, always dancing just ahead, never close enough to touch.<br><br> <br><br>Meanwhile, Neraverine wriggled as the darkness strained around him. The walls were tight, anathema to the open forests of his home, but he persisted. Breathing was difficult and every part of his body hurt, but that was nothing new. <em>You have survived worse</em>, he told himself grimly. <em>The only way out is through</em>.<br><br>The rock became spongy and caught in motion. He was spun, or inverted, or maybe soaked in oil and set alight. Neraverine twisted, finding the corridor airless and cold. A light came over him, thin, permeable, and he kept crawling, holding tightly to his grievances. He told himself that he clung to that innate part of himself that would push back, the fight in him, his anomalous sense of justice. But Neraverine was mortal and he had been grieving all those long days underground. Behind his self-righteousness was something softer and brighter: a desire to see the High Priestess again.<br><br>Leun’s words echoed in his ears: <em>When Sakharek was excluded, he left behind an exit wound. It lies at the base of the White Spire. It is a hole in the World perfectly aligned with a hole in the Veil. If you crawl in, you can pass through the Veil and into the Void</em>.<br><br>Even someone as godless as Neraverine knew the Void was where they kept the dead.<br><br>He tried to call out for her, wishing he knew her Name. The display caught the attention of a gaping hollow.<br><br><em>What brings you here?</em> The Void hissed. Its voice was sibilant and soft, seeming to annul all background noise or thoughts that it encountered. By hearing it, Neraverine felt like less, like he was vanishing in degrees.<br><br><em>I seek the High Priestess of Hope</em>. Neraverine strained to make the thought as tangible as possible, soaking it in his memories, hoping the Void would pluck the thought from his head and give him an answer.<br><br><em>You are still of the World. You found my wound.</em> The Void wailed now, placing a foreign grief on Neraverine’s soul that crushed him flat. <em>When the World expelled me into the nothingness… I did not want to become nothing. I do not want to be nothing.</em><br><br>Something disembodied brushed against Neraverine. He flinched. It was wet, grainy, warm.<br><br>  <em>Unsung and chained, here we rot by their neglect. Diffusing… subsisting off scraps of the World… always half now, never whole again, always half, less than that, always less… and Nameless, what are we called? Who are we? Who were we?</em><br><br><em>You are Sakharek.</em> Neraverine experimented with solidarity.<br><br><em>Sakharek!</em> For a moment, a static sound rose, loud and tangible, ready to sweep Neraverine back out of the exit wound and into the World. Then, the voice came again, more quietly: <em>What is our Name?</em><br><br><em>I seek the High Priestess of Hope</em>. Neraverine pushed through the miasma of despair and confusion, thinking of when the High Priestess had asked him to dance, the moment when he had considered what life could have been like if the World had been different, if Neraverine had been another person.<br><br><em>Yuumei.</em> Her Name. Neraverine grasped it in both hands. He knew the meaning behind the word – apostate, a person who renounces their religion. He wondered if she had known her name to be a harbinger.<br><br><em>YUUMEI</em>. Stirring in the Void, something echoed back.<br><br>  <em>When you see Syra again, tell him his antithesis is lying in wait. Tell him we are cold and lonely. Tell him we will never stop reaching for him.</em><br><br>Then Yuumei was there, and Neraverine forgot everything else.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>"

Not by Syra. Not by The-Wheel-That-Breaks-All. Not by the World, the Veil nor the Void.<br><br>Some things should not be witnessed.<br><br> <br><br>At the end of all things, Leun cast her mind back and imagined this story’s beginnings.<br><br> <br><br>Did it start with Leun, foetal, looking at the wide sky and contemplating the blessing of her gods, not yet aware that she now ranked among them? Wondering why she could have been both blessed and forsaken, both granted the power to survive anything but abandoned to the cruel whims of the unfaithful? Was that how all this started – Leun realizing the terrible neglect of her Gods but not yet realizing that she too had inherited their awful, despicable apathy?<br><br> <br><br>The story didn’t start with those faded years pilgrimaging to Syra. Not when she finally found him atop the northern mountain face and prostrated herself before him, pledging her eternal service. Nor did they start when she forsook his service after those first three centuries of thankless devotion and the many following where she wandered, looking to cure her immortality. There was nothing to be said about eventually asking Syra why he left her to die and discovering that he had not believed she would care, because there was nothing in him that she could recognize as human, and that even if she cared now he guaranteed that when enough time passed it wouldn’t matter anymore. Time absolves all things.<br><br>The story skimmed over Leun’s empires and epic poems. It equally excluded the moment she had forsaken her subjects, bored with power and more bored still with immortality. Her thousands of children went unnamed, as did her heartbreaks, and every time she would have died but did not.<br><br>She did not want to tell stories of the grey millennia during which she had painstakingly learned everything there was to learn and completely forgotten what it meant to be alive.<br><br> <br><br>Was this how the story started? Millenia after Leun’s cruel making, when Saynu opened her infinite wings and took flight without a word of farewell? Syra was bereft. He brought cataclysms to the planet. Leun tasted his grief: drowned in his floods and smothered in his volcanic ash. But Saynu did not come back.<br><br>He found Leun eventually. She was his last recourse. They had nothing left but each other. Leun remembered dying for Syra, she remembered worshipping him, she remembered pitying him. By that point, there was nothing inside of her but a low, seething contempt towards anything immortal.<br><br>“We have to find Saynu.” He told her.<br><br>She thought about how it had felt when the infidels had pulled that sword from her gut, how it had been less agonizing than Syra’s abandonment. The pain of the memory was muted and indistinct, the familiarity of the betrayal almost comforting. She was surprised she had managed to hold onto the grudge for this long.<br><br>She thought about asking why, but she knew that it had no answer at all. Behind that one word lay Sakharek’s forbidden void. She felt so tired, looking at him: her former God, her old world, her oldest wound. He was naked in his grief. She once again wanted to pull him open and sift through his strings with her sharp hands, searching for the vanished filaments of compassion that had made him the Progenitor once.<br><br>“I can’t do this without her.” She had never seen his eyes this wild. Was it sinking in, the acceptance after the anger? She knew how that felt.<br><br>Leun thought about all the places she saw Saynu – in the lepper cast from a community, the invisible gas that killed in the mines, the baby abandoned in the forest to die. The Wheel-That-Breaks-All had not left the world. But the person – Saynu – the personification that stood as the antithesis of person had vanished. If there was anything Leun could still feel, it was raw disgust that anything as unfeeling and cruel as Saynu had ever shared a plane of reality with Leun.<br><br>Syra had nothing to offer Leun. He could not kill her and make it stick; there was nothing else that mattered. Likewise, Leun had nothing she could keep from Syra. Eventually, she would help him. He only needed to wait. That was reality when you had eternity.<br><br> <br><br>So, was that the beginning of the story? When Leun agreed to help Syra find Saynu? Or was it when Saynu vanished? Or was it when Leun didn’t die, and the next time she didn’t die, and the next?<br><br> <br><br>Oh, like it should matter where it began. Like everything adrift in Leun’s contextless life, the scale of her existence made the beginning of the story insignificant. Regardless of when it started, Leun was exhausted. She understood what it meant to have limits, to surpass them, to exhaust every resource and continue breathing as a ghost of yourself. Inevitably and futility were two flavours of helplessness Leun knew intimately. She could not abide this flat hopeless world. It was unsurvivable and she was forced to survive it.<br><br>As she had infinite of times before and would infinite times again, Leun decided to fight life with more life: to raise a child. It just so happened that the latest of Syra’s schemes to entice Saynu back to the World involved a motherless child. She could do him a favour and help herself in the bargain.<br><br>Unlike Syra, who was vulnerable and loved too much, Neraverine belonged in a story. To Leun’s grand scale where mortals were raindrops in an ocean, he was a principle, not a person. Leun had met a few like him before, in her time. Sometimes they became folk heroes, other times they carved their bloody mark into history. They always died young.<br><br>There was something different about children. Innocence, Leun supposed. Neraverine wore his like lead armour, soft and heavy. Under that armour bloomed the mortal wound dealt by Syra. It killed him by degrees. At first, he was interesting, because in his short life he had already managed to deviate so far from the path Syra laid out for him. Leun loved him because he was the first respite from her boredom since Sin had come to her and asked for her help.<br><br>He was not the first child that Leun had raised and loved and would lose. But it had been so long since she had shared herself with anyone that the love felt new, healing, in a way she was unprepared for. Even against eternity, the numbness was not absolute. Little Neraverine, who was more stubborn than God, wormed his way into her heart. She let him, all the while trying to prepare herself for the hurt she would incur by loving him.<br><br>So she manufactured her own hope, using the strongest force on hand: Neraverine’s spite.<br><br>Neraverine made a more convincing God than Syra. Saynu had been God in absolution and apathy. But Syra was a twilight patchwork of hope dotted with despair, an immortal with the heart of a human and thrice the capacity for love. Sometimes, Leun could remember why she had worshipped him. Other times, she reached for conscious thought and found nothing but static.<br><br>She had not been designed to live this long. Like everything with Saynu, it was not oversight but design. Leun had long given up on being able to understand Saynu’s intentions in granting her immortality, but a small part of her still hoped that there had been a plan and one day it would become apparent.<br><br> <br><br>Perhaps this was what Saynu had intended: Leun on the shore of a great black mirror consumed by a desperation so ancient and voiceless that Leun wore it like a ball and chain.<br><br>“You didn’t listen to Yuumei.” Leun told the water gently lapping at her feet. “I thought you may have at least considered a message from your own disillusioned High Priestess.”<br><br>Saynu did not reply, because Saynu did not inhabit the World.<br><br>“Neraverine is hurting.” Leun’s own hurt was lodged in her chest, like a bolder rolled before a tomb. It could not be shifted, and if it could, she feared what would emerge. “Syra is hurting, damn him. You’re nowhere to be found. People are dying, the World is dying… everything will die. I wonder if you care. The Wheel will turn all the same.”<br><br>More silence.<br><br>“You wrote this story.” Leun was beyond expressing emotion, but she felt a wisp of it curling through her mouth all the same. “Why can’t you end it? I’m so tired.”<br><br>The water was cold, shining with the mirror-black night. It was up to her waist now, caressing her hipbones. She would regret this. In the past, successive deaths had not granted Leun an audience. It was foolish to hope now, of all times. With a sigh, the abyss looked through her.<br><br>“You told me to look after him. You made me to protect him.” Leun looked at her feet, wondering if this rehearsal was strictly necessary. But maybe Saynu could hear even as she draped herself in the Void. “I couldn’t help him. Maybe I wouldn’t. He’s not my brother. This cannot go on. You… you are incapable of understanding what you have done to me. But at least acknowledge what you did to him. Come back… Even if it’s only to say goodbye. He’s setting himself on fire to be your beacon.”<br><br>Leun exhaled for as long as she could. Once her lungs began to burn, she began to swim in earnest.<br><br>Gurgle. Splash. <em>Cccckhrgh cccck cccchch rrrgh</em>. The bubbles ceased. Leun’s body went prone in the water.<br><br><strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. Leun screamed, unseeing, uncertain if she was caught in the half-state between life and death or choking on the water, soon to die or just be reborn. It did not matter. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>.<br><br>The faithful abyss dragged her back to the world of the living. Leun wanted to hiss, to rage. Instead, she gulped water, choking and coughing. If she sank – if she sank no weakness of the flesh could undo this. There would be no going back. The space between deaths would be shorter, and maybe, just maybe, her time pressing up against the Veil would be long enough to be heard<em>. Cccckgh aaaacccckkkkcckck.</em><br><br><em>Nothing is worth this pain</em>, Leun’s body sang. <em>Danger!</em> Ignorant flesh. Nothing could hurt Leun, Saynu had seen to that.<br><br><strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. Leun chanted again, delirious and unmoored, possibly just gurgling with the last of her air. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong> <strong><em>HE HAS TEYU</em></strong> <strong><em>DAMN YOU SAYNU DAMN YOU DAMN YOU HE PLUCKED THE SUN FROM THE SKY FOR YOU DAMN YOU SAYNU HE WILL DIE SAYNU</em></strong>.<br><br>Leun’s eyes opened to black water. Reflexively, her body tried to inhale. It took in more water. The last vestiges of air escaped her nose. She gagged, but it was all water, in her and around her, all water, all dark. The pressure forced her shoulder out of its joint and Leun pushed the agony away, searching.<br><br>In the mirror. Not behind it – in the glass, like a fly in amber. This was the gateway, wasn’t it? This was the river, the precarious hinterland. So where was the boatman? Water filled every orifice. Where was Hope? Was this the space between two mirrors, looking forwards and backwards into herself, through herself, past herself, an infinite number of copies stretching across universes? Or, worse, was she just pressed against the glass, pleading again for entry as she had so many times before, like a moth against the pane of a lantern petitioning to be set ablaze?<br><br><strong><em>SAYNU.</em></strong> Leun repeated. The water shook and the word was not quite voiced. She died. She tried again. She died.<br><br>In death, she spoke it again: <strong><em>SAYNU.</em></strong> She gargled back to life and lost it moments later. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>.<br><br>In her addled state, the body took over. It thrashed, trying to pull her towards the surface. <em>Breathe!</em> It ordered. But it was too late. She was waterlogged and weak. It was dark all around, no moonlight, no up and no down. Just the abyss and desperation that was colder than the water.<br><br><em>Just me</em>. Leun thought. <em>I always hated to drown</em>. And then: <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>.<br><br>Physical reality bled. Utterly alone, apart from the world, Leun could not speak nor feel. Still: <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. She did not say <strong><em>PLEASE</em></strong> or <strong><em>LET ME IN</em></strong> as she had in the past, pounding against the Veil and staring hungrily into the Void. Just <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>, a simple plea for a hand to hold against the nothing. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong> – a demand for acknowledgement, for Hope. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>.<br><br>In the abyss, through murky water and dense fog and a labyrinth of mirrors, Leun saw something move.<br><br>  <em> </em><br><br>  <em>Let it go, Child of the World.</em><br><br>Leun struggled against the sweet words, a bee drowning in honey. She could not vocalize disagreement but she shifted, fought in the only way her body knew how, like the lamb thrashing in the maw of the wolf. She could only remember one word, a word that held terrible importance, that burst from her mouth of its own volition. She no longer knew what it meant. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>.<br><br><em>Yes, Child. Let it go and go home</em>.<br><br><strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. Leun did not let go. She wriggled and fought. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. The word hooked through her lip and dragged her against the cold ice of nothing and no one.<br><br> <em>Yes, Child, I am here</em>. <em>You can stop calling for me.</em><br><br>Leun did not understand the melody surrounding her, only that she had to do something so important but she could not remember what. Again, the word rose in her mind like the inevitable tide: <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. Then, another word joined it, something from her limbic system, spoken without her conscious consent: <strong><em>IT HURTS, SAYNU. IT HURTS</em></strong>.<br><br><em>My Witness, my little God</em>,<em> go home to my brother. It will not hurt there. This is not a place for you.</em><br><br>Leun was stretched between fire and ice, entombed in vapour, at once existing and not. Still, she writhed, weeping, struggling. <strong><em>SAYNU</em></strong>. <strong><em>PLEASE</em></strong>. She tried to broadcast the urgency inside her, the abject need.<br><br>  <em>You are persistent, my niece.</em><br><br>There was an unearthly sound Leun had heard once before, at the beginning of all this: infinite simultaneous wingbeats caught in the motions of flight. It sounded like bells or waking up from a dream. It drowned her. Then the upwards momentum caught her and she was soaring, flying somewhere airless where nothing cool and free rushed to meet her face, flying in a directionless void where anywhere could have been up.<br><br><em>The only way out is through</em>. The voice was without intonation or warmth. But, still, Leun knew the words were intended to comfort her.<br><br>They soared together for a fraction of a second that, when unravelled, contained simultaneous multitudes of lifetimes harmonizing together to form the red string of fate. When caught in the labyrinth of mirrors, running this yarn through your palm would bring you to the exit, and exit they did.<br><br> <br><br>Leun’s eyelids fluttered against reality. Around her was humid air, flashes of brilliance, the stirrings of a storm.<br><br> <br><br>When she came back to herself, once the water had been coughed from her body and she lay, wet, half-dead, she saw the shifting shapes of Saynu before her. Her eyes fluttered as the merciless sharp wing edges cut across her vision, dancing in the half-light, dizzying and impossible.<br><br>“Will you explain to me now, niece mine, why you pounded so urgently upon my door?”<br><br>Leun could not tell if Saynu was being ironic, or if she were incapable of a gesture so human. She shut her eyes and considered what to say. There were many problems Saynu was uniquely equipped to solve. The foremost was Leun’s immortality, but that conversation had been exhausted before Saynu’s exodus. It was likely that if Leun begged to be made mortal once more, Saynu would just leave with new resolve to ignore Leun’s pleading face pressed against the Veil.<br><br>“Did you meet Yuumei?” Leun asked, stalling for time. “I sent her with a message for you.”<br><br>“The Apostate?” Saynu tilted her head. She would remember Yuumei. Gods did not forget. “She wanted nothing more than swift submersion in the Void. I granted her this. She was confused. There was no meaningful message to be divined from her.”<br><br>“Syra misses you.” Leun rushed to get the rest of the words out. Saynu was not concerned with emotions, nor her brother’s wellbeing. If anything, as the God of the Veil, of suffering, as The-Wheel-That-Breaks-All, she probably imagined it brought them closer together. “It broke him, being alone. He took Teyu from the sky as part of a scheme to lure you back.”<br><br>“My brother did what?” Even through her closed eyelids, Leun saw the glow, felt the incandescent heat.<br><br>“He pulled the Sun from the sky.” Leun wondered if Saynu would reveal more of her true form from the Veil, and if it would kill her. “He is driving the World to ruin, all to bring you back.”<br><br>“Syra cannot destroy the World without destroying himself.” <em>She doesn’t understand him at all</em>, Leun thought helplessly. “I will not cave to his threats.<br><br>The shifting of wings. She was going to leave. Saynu was about to open her wings, again, and-<br><br>“He seeks annihilation!” Leun shouted. “Because he cannot bear to be alone.”<br><br>“He is not alone. He has his World. I gave him you.” Leun felt herself being scrutinized. “Are you so inadequate a companion?”<br><br><em>I don’t want to be his companion and he doesn’t want me to be. But we tried.</em> Leun considered telling the truth. <em>It hurt</em>. <em>I wasn’t made for eternity.</em><br><br>“Please talk to him.” Leun said instead. “I was Named Witness and I have been trying to fulfil the purpose you gave me. But now – as he threatens everything – I find it necessary to act. You are the only one he will listen to. Please ask him to stop. Maybe take him with you.”<br><br>“If Syra enters the Veil, the World will implode.” <em>Maybe that’s better than the World’s slow death by degrees</em>, Leun thought. “He must remain here.”<br><br>Leun threw herself on her front in absolute supplication. She pressed her forehead to the earth and prayed, inside, to the God before her: <em>You made me to love him and I do not, but he hurts and only you can stop that. The Sun walks among us. This is not right. I do not ask you to allow me entry to the Veil, even though it is all that I want, because as a denizen of the World I know this to be more important.</em><br><br>Leun’s ears popped. Something receded. She risked opening an eye partway and saw Saynu before her in human skin. The vessel was clearly modelled from Yuumei, tall and fair-haired, dressed in ecclesiastic extravagance. It was an uncanny disguise, transparent and flat, quite out of place on this plane. But it no longer wounded to perceive. Was this acquiescence?<br><br> <br><br>Again, Leun was lifted and shuffled. She curled and shut her eyes.<br><br> <br><br>When they opened again, she found herself in a forest clearing. It took her a moment to recognize it as the site of the Solstice Massacre, when Syra had brought the Sun to the World in his rage at Neraverine’s defiance. There had only been three witnesses: Neraverine, the deceased High Priestess, and Syra. Of them, Neraverine stood before her, one leg still missing, leaning on wood. Besides him was Teyu, looking like a cornered animal, knife melting in her glowing hand. To their left was Syra. He shone, wings shifting in and out of reality, unable to be contained in the face of his euphoria. Under the emotion, you could see his sickness in his withered true form. She had never seen him so rotted. Leun followed his line of sight and found Saynu, still a flat and unconvincing facsimile of Yuumei.<br><br>“I take it that this is the mortal who outwilled you.” Saynu raised an arm towards Neraverine, who flinched so violently he almost fell to the ground. “That is pathetic even for you, brother. This is what you should have done.”<br><br>That was not what Leun had predicted. She heard the wooden creaking of the Wheel-That-Breaks-All and she thought: <em>perhaps my body can slow this new violence.</em><br><br>Leun leapt at Saynu. It did not matter. She phased right through the Wheel and landed hard on the ground, her arm snapping under her. Off to her left, Neraverine exploded into fine red mist. Leun could taste him on her next inhale.<br><br>Pressing her face to the earth, Leun wept. Another son dead. Another turn of the Wheel. She could not bear it, but she knew that she would bear it, that the version of her who could not live with it would die and another Leun would rise in its place, colder, harder, more apathetic and ruthless than ever before. This would keep repeating until she was less than a speck of dust and identical to that which she most despised.<br><br>This was worse than obliteration, it was corruption, it was unwilling transformation, it was the death of everything she loved.<br><br> <br><br>Leun hadn’t really cared for the Sun, nor the World, nor the Moon. Equally, she did not care for the Veil nor the Void. Not even for Syra. Her hatred for Saynu was hollow, old, half-forgotten. She just wanted Neraverine to survive this, as no mortal survived a God’s games, because she loved him and he had burned so brightly.<br><br> <br><br>As she wept, Leun heard something crack. She looked up. Before her, stood Neraverine. He toppled over almost immediately, unable to balance on one leg. She tilted her head. Blinked. He remained, in an ungainly pile on the floor.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>Syra and Saynu looked at one another. The melted remains of Teyu’s knife slipped from her hand. Leun gaped. Neraverine pushed himself up with one hand into a sitting position. He coughed.<br><br>“This is your doing, brother?” Saynu was unsettled. Leun had never seen the self-assurance stripped away.<br><br>Syra shook his head, eyes wide.<br><br>“Sakharek?” Leun whispered. Had he reached the White Spire, and contacted the Void? Neraverine’s eyes met hers. <em>Sakharek</em>. Leun did not think that name often. Voidkeeper. The third of their Gods, the one she had never met.<br><br>Leun, who had migrated to the Veil, who knew the space between the World and the Veil to be infinite and impossible to traverse, could not imagine passing through the Veil itself. She was proud. She was scared. For the first time, she wondered if Neraverine were more than human.<br><br>Neraverine bared his teeth at Syra. Under his weariness, she could see his spite: steadfast and deafening.<br><br>“I missed you, Saynu.” Syra sighed, voice wavering and whistling like distant birdsong. He was closer to annihilation than Leun had thought. He looked at Saynu with unequivocal devotion.<br><br>Something guilt-shaped passed across Leun’s chest. It wasn’t tangible, not quite an emotion, rather the acknowledgement that guilt would be appropriate. She ignored it. If Syra died, she would neither need to grieve him nor survive this. Finally, after millennia crushed under the Wheel-That-Breaks-All, unable to escape to the Void, Leun would be allowed release.<br><br>Saynu moved towards Leun in a direct line, the body’s limbs not moving, the feet breaking and bleeding on the ground as they caught on the uneven terrain without budging, until her vessel’s nose almost touched Leun’s. Their proximity reminded Leun of the hollow motions of Yuumei’s murder.<br><br>“What a spectacle.” Saynu was as unreadable as always. She reached out and swaddled Leun in her wings.<br><br><em>Saynu is capable of softness</em>? Leun thought. Then she felt cold fingers against her mind and she relaxed, tried to make it hurt less. If Saynu wanted to see what Leun had lived, she would. It was just a question of mitigating damage. Leun did not have the futile bravery of Neraverine. She let Saynu read her memories and intentions without struggling.<br><br>Leun’s eyes snapped open. Saynu still faced her. Now, she could feel wave after wave of sighs rolling off the God of the Veil, hitting her straight on with enough force to make Leun stagger back. Under the vessel, infinite maws snapped closed and open, teeth gnashing, hungry.<br><br>“You arrogant little God.” Saynu spoke with simultaneous pride and disappointment. “Fine. Have it your way, Witness.” She turned to Neraverine. “We’re headed towards an irreversible cataclysm thanks to the idiocy of my brother. The architect of this abysmal scheme wishes for you to decide how it ends.”<br><br>This was the gift she had carefully prepared for him. It was more important than saving him from pain or predetermination. It was not fair to the World, nor the Gods. Neraverine had not earned it. But she still gave it to him – a choice to end the many other choices he had been denied throughout his life.<br><br>One choice: was Saynu to stay, or to go?<br><br>“You can ask Saynu to leave.” Leun offered, trying not to cringe as Syra whimpered at the idea. “The World will fully wither and the Veil will collapse. Syra, Saynu and Sakharek will become one once more. The Sun and Moon will reunite. The dead remains of the World will be obliterated in the middle. Or, you can ask Saynu to stay. Syra will put the Sun back in the Sky and our existences will perpetuate.”<br><br>Like before meant Leun running in ever-decreasing circles, periodically crushed by The-Wheel-That-Breaks-All, watching the World bloom and burn around her as the enslaved Sun and Moon screamed in their torturous freefall. She was tired of outliving her children. Syra was the World, the subject of her great ambivalence, an ever-growing environment dominated by cycles, splattered with suffering and joy beyond meaning, eternally grieving his sister who lay just beyond the Veil, encircling him but always too distant to touch.<br><br>With infinity on the horizon, what would stop Syra from choosing another mortal to act out another of his songs? What was stopping Leun from pounding on the Veil until Saynu returned for a brief, derisive visit next time Syra sought annihilation in his loneliness? How many Neraverines would follow in this one’s footsteps? Leun could see this repeating, again and again, until some iteration of Neraverine made the choice to cast the World aside.<br><br>“Sakharek is lonelier than Syra could ever be.” Neraverine muttered. He did not sound like himself. Leun tilted her head, wondering what was amiss, how his voice contained multitudes. “They did not choose to be the remainder. Behind the Veil, they swim in emptiness with nothing but a handful of mortal souls to keep them sane. They forgot their Name.”<br><br>The moon was beginning to rise. Teyu was fixated on it, an awful expression affixed to her glowing face. Leun closed her eyes. No outcome was without its victims. Likewise, no outcome was without its benefactors.<br><br>“This is broken.” It was as though someone else spoke through Neraverine’s mouth. She couldn’t place his Name by seeing him as she usually could, instead a curious mass of overlapping sounds reached her. Her eyes widened as she recognized that Yuumei was in there, with him. A soul had crossed the Veil? Leun had no way of knowing which one of them was speaking, or if more yet souls were contained within. “Goodbye, Saynu.”<br><br>She inclined her head and vanished.<br><br>Syra screamed.<br><br> <br><br>Leun spent the last days with Yuumei-Neraverine, feeling a little awe and grief that this affair had turned out in exactly the way she had intended. They left Syra next to Teyu, who was still locked in spot, growing in heat and light. Soon, her vessel would not be able to contain her, and the Sun would engulf the World. Then the divine forces would coalesce once more. Perhaps another world would make itself known. Perhaps not. Leun would not be there to see it.<br><br>“I want to see some trees before I die.” Yuumei-Neraverine spoke slowly now they needed to negotiate every word that left their shared mouth.<br><br>Leun took them to the forest of Neraverine’s childhood. The trees had no leaves and small animal carcasses littered the ground. This was what happened when Syra halted the seasons and stole the Sun.<br><br>“Maybe we’ll miss this.” Yuumei-Neraverine said. They held a tree trunk in both hands. Leun recognized the tree as one of the few living things exceeding Leun in age. Once, it had been a sapling, some four thousand orbits around the Sun past, when she had been the High Priestess of Syra.<br><br>It had passed dormancy into death. It would not regrow. Leun allowed herself to become emotional, looking at the corpse of her elder. <em>I’ll see you again soon</em>.<br><br>“When it all comes together again…” Yuumei-Neraverine paused, seeming to wrestle internally. “Sakharek said it would be different. No more boundaries – no more Veil. There will be a new world that doesn’t resemble this one. It couldn’t exist unless we didn’t. They said this one is built on grief, on separation. It was doomed from the start.”<br><br>Leun nodded, privately uncertain. They tried to make it to Yuumei’s cathedral, but the journey was too hard. Occasionally, in the distance, they could see small figures shuffling around, fruitlessly scouring the ground to find something growing.<br><br>At the end, they sat together on a bed of rotting leaves. One of Yuumei-Neraverine’s eyes leaked tears. The other stayed stoic. Leun held their hand as the last sunrise annihilated the three of them.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br><hr /><h1> </h1><h1>Postscript: A note on our new gods</h1> <br><br>There is a point of infinite density and infinite mass poised on the cusp of explosion.<br><br>"
